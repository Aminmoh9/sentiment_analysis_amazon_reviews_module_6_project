B00XYVE4B8,3.0,Good for small apartments,"I was NOT given this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you about my first experience with this washer. I live in a small apartment and the nearest laundromat is too inconvenient for me to walk to. My car is always on the fritz and there are no laundry departments in my building. So I decided to look into a portable washer. I found this one that holds up to about 9lbs of clothes for under $70 on Amazon. Pretty good bargain. It arrived yesterday and it is much bigger than I thought it would be but very light. When I took it out of the packaging, I noticed a red ink mark on the lid and some black ink smeared on the safety disc thing for the spin cycle. Wasn't sure if that came from manufacturing or not. I washed off the red ink but the black wouldn't come off. The way my kitchen is designed made it difficult for me to sit this on my counter so I sat it on a chair in the bathroom where I could easily fill it with a few buckets of water and drain straight into the toilet. The sink hook up does fit my kitchen sink so if I had the space, I could've hooked it up there with no problem. I filled the machine to the medium marker, added detergent, then clothes  and filled with more water as necessary. The drain hose seemed like it was gonna spill out so I stuck my finger in it to prevent spilling since i didn't have anything small enough to fit the hole and left it the duration of the wash and the rinse. It drains very quickly which is good. I didn't use the spin cycle because I have a Nina Soft Spin Dryer by Laundry Alternative which is amazing for those who don't know. You can find those on Amazon as well. So I can't review the spin cycle. Overall I'm happy with the product. Makes my laundry days much easier. I only gave it 3 stars since I couldn't comment at all on the spin cycle. I would recommend to a friend though.",2016-06-10 16:38:07.000000000,2016,Neutral,ARKSEN Portable Mini Washing Machine 8-9LBS Dorm Camping RV Compact Laundry Washer,Appliances,

B07VDSJ4Z6,1.0,"Poor design, seems very dangerous.","To light the oven, you have to open the door all the way, turn the knob on full, and once the gas is lit, you have to wait a few moments to set the temperature you want, or the flame will go out. If you do it wrong, the oven will still release gas without lighting it. This strikes me as being extremely dangerous in a household appliance, particularly when most gas ovens let you just set the temperature, and everything works. I am astonished that they manufacture and sell an oven without safety interlocks to keep the oven from filling the house with gas.<br />I have only had it one day, but have already had to reset the clock several times, because it loses the time, resets itself to 12:00, and starts blinking. It seems to keep time for maybe an hour or so.<br />The instruction manual is very poorly written, and has two sections on how to set the clock. One of them is for how to set minutes, the other is for how to set hours, but you kind of have to figure that out for yourself.<br />The temperature settings are printed around the outside edge of the dial, making it very difficult to see what the temperature is set at unless you are right next to the oven. They should have been printed on the face of the dial so they could be seen from a few feet away.<br />This was the only 30"" gas wall oven I could find, so I took a chance on it. I regret that decision, and wish I had gone with electric, because then I would have had a better selection.<br />Since I had to wait for a custom cabinet to be made, I was past the return time when I discovered these issues. Now I am stuck just eating the cost of this terrible product and installing something else that will not put my family at risk.<br />UPDATE - got it taken out, installed an electric oven in its place. I am much happier without this explosion waiting to happen in my kitchen. But I am still stuck with this terrible product taking up room in my garage, because I cannot in good conscience sell it to someone else and put them at risk.",2021-03-24 11:27:56.625000000,2021,Negative,Summit SGWO30SS 30 Inch Wide 3 Cu.
