B00XYVE4B8,3.0,Good for small apartments,"I was NOT given this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you about my first experience with this washer. I live in a small apartment and the nearest laundromat is too inconvenient for me to walk to. My car is always on the fritz and there are no laundry departments in my building. So I decided to look into a portable washer. I found this one that holds up to about 9lbs of clothes for under $70 on Amazon. Pretty good bargain. It arrived yesterday and it is much bigger than I thought it would be but very light. When I took it out of the packaging, I noticed a red ink mark on the lid and some black ink smeared on the safety disc thing for the spin cycle. Wasn't sure if that came from manufacturing or not. I washed off the red ink but the black wouldn't come off. The way my kitchen is designed made it difficult for me to sit this on my counter so I sat it on a chair in the bathroom where I could easily fill it with a few buckets of water and drain straight into the toilet. The sink hook up does fit my kitchen sink so if I had the space, I could've hooked it up there with no problem. I filled the machine to the medium marker, added detergent, then clothes  and filled with more water as necessary. The drain hose seemed like it was gonna spill out so I stuck my finger in it to prevent spilling since i didn't have anything small enough to fit the hole and left it the duration of the wash and the rinse. It drains very quickly which is good. I didn't use the spin cycle because I have a Nina Soft Spin Dryer by Laundry Alternative which is amazing for those who don't know. You can find those on Amazon as well. So I can't review the spin cycle. Overall I'm happy with the product. Makes my laundry days much easier. I only gave it 3 stars since I couldn't comment at all on the spin cycle. I would recommend to a friend though.",2016-06-10 16:38:07.000000000,2016,Neutral,ARKSEN Portable Mini Washing Machine 8-9LBS Dorm Camping RV Compact Laundry Washer,Appliances,

B07VDSJ4Z6,1.0,"Poor design, seems very dangerous.","To light the oven, you have to open the door all the way, turn the knob on full, and once the gas is lit, you have to wait a few moments to set the temperature you want, or the flame will go out. If you do it wrong, the oven will still release gas without lighting it. This strikes me as being extremely dangerous in a household appliance, particularly when most gas ovens let you just set the temperature, and everything works. I am astonished that they manufacture and sell an oven without safety interlocks to keep the oven from filling the house with gas.<br />I have only had it one day, but have already had to reset the clock several times, because it loses the time, resets itself to 12:00, and starts blinking. It seems to keep time for maybe an hour or so.<br />The instruction manual is very poorly written, and has two sections on how to set the clock. One of them is for how to set minutes, the other is for how to set hours, but you kind of have to figure that out for yourself.<br />The temperature settings are printed around the outside edge of the dial, making it very difficult to see what the temperature is set at unless you are right next to the oven. They should have been printed on the face of the dial so they could be seen from a few feet away.<br />This was the only 30"" gas wall oven I could find, so I took a chance on it. I regret that decision, and wish I had gone with electric, because then I would have had a better selection.<br />Since I had to wait for a custom cabinet to be made, I was past the return time when I discovered these issues. Now I am stuck just eating the cost of this terrible product and installing something else that will not put my family at risk.<br />UPDATE - got it taken out, installed an electric oven in its place. I am much happier without this explosion waiting to happen in my kitchen. But I am still stuck with this terrible product taking up room in my garage, because I cannot in good conscience sell it to someone else and put them at risk.",2021-03-24 11:27:56.625000000,2021,Negative,Summit SGWO30SS 30 Inch Wide 3 Cu.

Using two filters at a time, corrected that issue and the owner has not only offered to refund my purchase price, but also offered to replace the current inventory of filters I have with the newer improved version.<br />I must say, that his determination to make sure that the customer is happy with his product is to be commended.  I will continue to use the filters and may even invest in a second EZ K Kup unit to keep my Keurig running for guests. This company certainly stands behind it's products and will go to great lengths to make sure that the customer is happy ...<br /><br />[First Post: I purchased this product and have been VERY disappointed.

B074QLYQ59,5.0,Solid product. Straight forward to install.,"Our Kenmore electric dryer finally stopped blowing hot air to dry our clothes. Instead of spending close to $1k to get a new dryer, I attempted to figure out what went wrong. After a few research on the web and watching a few YouTube videos, it was fairly straight forward to diagnose and I found out the heating element went bad. A few research on Amazon and I bump to this product. The site is very useful as it listed all the models that are compatible to the part number. Best yet, it also comes with the thermal fuse cut off kit. My thermal fuse kit still worked but I decided to replace them anyway. The product arrived fairly quick even with the situation that we have now and replacing the heat element and the thermal fuse cut off kit were straight forward. So far, it heating element has holding up for more than 2 weeks and we have gone through close to 8 loads of drying. I highly recommend this product and it has saved me hundreds of dollars from replacing the entire dryer.",2020-04-20 03:55:21.627000093,2020,Positive,3387747 & 279973 Dryer Heating Element With Dryer Thermal Cut-off Fuse Kit by BlueStars - Exact Fit for Whirlpool & Kenmore Dryers - Replaces 80003 WP3387747 3391913 AP3094323,Tools & Home Improvement,$25.97

You do have to completely dismantle the dryer but Samsung do make it easy, it’s pretty much a putty knife, a Phillips screwdriver and an hour of your time...needless to say you should UNPLUG your dryer from the power supply because motors can KILL you if they are connected to the power source. Great price on this motor! Use the opportunity to vacuum out any lint and also cut any tangled hair from the drum rollers. Don’t forget to reconnect the plugs for the moisture sensor and the drum light before you put it back together, oh and the belt, line the belt up with the wear line on the drum and use tape to hold it to the drum, lean the machine back against the wall and pull the tension pulley over before you attach it to the motor spindle, it just makes it easier.

B000UVMUNO,1.0,Wouldn't every buy a Bosch dishwasher again!,"I purchased a Bosch SHX98M09UC dishwasher in less than a year ago in October, 2009 for about $1500. We do no more than 2 to 3 loads a week. Good points: EXTREMELY quiet. Bad points - just about everything else. The worst thing, and it is VERY BAD - is the smell.  There is a ""chemical"" smell that eminates from the dishwasher that fills our kitchen. After doing Internet searches, I found this to be a common issue with Bosch dishwashers. It is truly nauseating and develops without any dishes in the dishwasher.<br /><br />Now after about 30 loads (max) a ""Check water supply"" message is being displayed on the LCD and the dishwasher no longer works.<br /><br />My only recommendation is to stay away from Bosch dishwashers!<br /><br />bert<br /><br />Update: We had a Bosch service company come down and look at it. It turns out that they had to replace the return hose - once they did this, the smell and message went away.",2010-10-04 14:38:55.000000000,2010,Negative,"Bosch SHX98M09UC 800 24"" Stainless Steel Semi-Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Amazon Home,

B093D8GRG1,5.0,Convenient for Small Homes,"It works well and is able to handle larger loads of laundry than other portable washers.  Been using it for a few weeks and I don't have any major issues.  Use is fairly self-explanatory and also comes with a simple guide on how to use it.  I am able to wash queen-size bedsheets (one at a time) but the comforter really pushes the drier to its capacity.  I wouldn't recommend anything larger or heavier than a light comforter.<br /><br />Cloths will come out of the spinner damp so plan on air-drying your clothes after they are done washing.  I have a simple hanger and set it under a fan.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you're going to have to drain your machine after you're done using it.  It does not have a motor to pump the water out and realizes on gravity.  I place my machine in my shower so I can easily drain.  Otherwise, I would recommend setting this up outside.<br /><br />As other people have said it is a bit more laborious than a standard washer/dryer but you're probably purchasing this because a washer/dryer isn't an option where you're living.<br /><br />Some complaints/suggestions:<br /><br />I would have liked the hose to fill/rinse the machine to be a bit longer and provide some attachments so I can put it on a faucet.<br /><br />The power cord is also quite short and I would have liked it to be a bit longer.<br /><br />This machine comes with static feet so you will not be able to adjust it for an unlevel surface.

B07B94ZR74,4.0,Awesome machine!,"I say KEEP the styrofoam packing. During the spin cycle without it perfectly balanced one the floor or the load in spinner… shakes all over. Putting the styrofoam on the bottom works wonders. You see where we use ours, you could do a cute little set up if creative enough. This works for us best. Does have its limits but a weeks worth of laundry will take you a few hours for sure. Maybe 4 all together. We just hang as you see and separate all out when done with all loads.

So this wasn't completely thought through.<br />With that said everything else looks excellent. Comes with wire nuts for wiring.<br />The wiring instructions are quite clear with text and a diagram. A plus is the switch is wired for if there a second switch for power. i.e. two doorways. So you can leave the other switch and just wire this into your current switch without running anything else.<br />Programming mode is clear in the instruction sheet.,2019-02-24 21:26:26.243000031,2019,Positive,"Interchangeable Face Cover for DWHOS PIR Humidity Sensor, Bathroom Fan Switch, In Wall Light Switch, Motion Sensor Switch by Enerlites, Black",Tools & Home Improvement,
B0045LLC7K,4.0,Beware of the extra ridge!,"First, this filter is shorter than the one I replaced, so I assume with less overall filtration surface the replacement won't last as long as the last one (which made it about a year).  This particular replacement was cheaper than other options, so I assume this is why.  I want to emphasize that this listing came up as an exact match for my Frigidaire Gallery.  Next comes the key intel besides just the unit size...<br /><br />Secondly -- remove the filter you are about to replace.  On the top you will see a square ridge that runs the length of the filter - its even visible while it's installed - think of it as rail guide so you slide the filter in properly.  If you see a SECOND narrower ridge beside this one - then the filter listed here is right for you.  If there is NOT a second guide, you need to find one with only the one main guide.<br /><br />I had to file that second ridge down with a hand file (10 minutes worth of filing) and this filter then slipped in no problem.  I hope this helps others avoid this little surprise.  Or, maybe you don't mind applying some ""elbow grease"" and want to go for the cheaper option.

B000G166QK,4.0,"Seals Pretty Well, Handy for Sealing Small Bags","This was a rare impulse buy. I logged on that day looking to buy a supply of Grip-Stics, which I LOVE for sealing food products right in the bag - prepackaged salads, chocolate chips, pancake mix, pretzels, and many more items. These tiny things function somewhat similarly to Grip-Stics, but they are designed for very small bags or packets. I've already used them for soy and duck sauce packets, sauce packets from frozen foods that come with dipping sauces, spice packets, and even the flavoring packet from ramen noodles (we think using the whole packet makes the broth too salty!).

It worked perfect and the lint came out like a cloud of dust. After running the brush back and forth, I used a electric blower to blow out the pipe from the inside of the home to the outside. Works Great. The extension rods screw together and progress as you run the brush in the pipe. The rods are flexible enough to go around the bends and still maintain enough stiffness to progress through the vent pipe. The clothes dryer has more air velocity and drying time has reduced due to more air flowing through the vent pipe. Also the chance of a fire hazard has been removed from lint buildup over the years Thanks.",2016-11-24 16:42:50.000000000,2016,Positive,"Deflecto DVBRUSH12K/6 Dryer Duct Cleaning Kit, Lint Remover, Extends Up to 12 Feet, Synthetic Brush Head, Use with or Without a Power Drill, accessory, Computer",None,$26.40

I know how expensive K-cups can be, which is why when I saw this product, I was excited.  I bought one.  The first time I tried it out, the coffee I got was a bit weak, but I figured I'd have some trial and error before I figured out the correct amount for my taste.  My problem was, I had trouble removing the EZ-Cup from the machine.  When it finally came out, I'd learned that the water temperature had caused the reusable pod to warp and crack.  This is after only one use.  So, I exchanged it for another, hoping it was just a flaw in the first one.  I managed to get two uses out of the second before it warped and cracked enough to render it unusable.  I'm sorry, but this product is a total waste of money.  I will have to find a better reusable pod to meet my needs.",2012-01-20 13:29:56.000000000,2012,Negative,Perfect Pod EZ-Cup for Keurig 1.0 brewers by Perfect Pod,Amazon Home,$9.90

The old glow plug was still glowing so I didn't think that was the problem. I researched the problem on the internet and read that even though the ignitor may glow if it didn't draw at least 3.1A it could cause problems like I was having. I measured mine at it drew only 2.7A. I had hoped for a ignitor with the correct end but the correct one was almost double this one. Since this one came with wire nuts I simply the end off mine and this one and wire nutted my end on this ignitor, worked like a charm! Now my oven starts very quickly and doesn't go out. I even ordered a spare for when it goes out again, apparently they only last ~5-8 years(depending on use) and mine was over 10 years so next time it happens I'll have a spare :) The two where still cheaper than 1 at most places, for sure locally.",2014-01-02 18:59:28.000000000,2014,Positive,GE WB2X9998 Flat Oven Ignitor,Appliances,$25.00

Called all of them, got variety of dead phones, a single person contractor who is yet to get his license and tools, or a company that does not have a certified tech. (What kind of repair center is that?)  The only company that does this type of jobs in my state first told me they are too backed up, so they cannot schedule my repair for 2 months. No problem I can wait, I have a backup fridge. Then after  several calls when I got on the first name basis with their representative he told me outright they do not want to fix LG, because they keep failing left and right after repair. They do not want to take my money - BTW its parts that are covered, labor is $400-$600 extra - and then hear my mad call in few months because it breaks down again and now they are involved.

Here is the key, once you put the filter in (super easy to do), and close the refrigerator doors, have a large pitcher and fill it up. You need to first get the air out, and then about 2 gallons of water before it comes out clear. The first gallon was greyish, but by the last gallon, it was clear. That's it.

After setting it up, I got the &#34;E1&#34; error message, and Customer Service said that it usually means the chip got wet, so they had me take it apart to see if it was corroded or if it somehow got wet (turns out my mister had caught it, oops). Dried it out with compressed air and it worked just fine. I have the temp  side hooked up to a small CPU fan which kicks on when the temp at the middle of the tank goes above 80 degrees, so the basking spot stays hot 24/7 but the cool side of the tank (where the fan pulls the air in) will be around 75 degrees. The humidity side is hooked up to a ExoTerra Monsoon mister, which kicks on for a few seconds when the humidity goes below 75%. I plan on getting a &#34;second opinion&#34; sensor to make sure it's reading correctly, because too low humidity can mean a bad shed, which is bad news for my tegu!

However, we have excellent tasting water that passes through a quality whole house water softener.  For 20 years we have put tap water in a glass pitcher in the fridge and used it for table drinking and filling water bottles.

B00N0GF98E,1.0,Do not buy this brand!,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. We bought a custom home 4.5 years ago; it had a FP double drawer dishwasher that we had to replace. It had two E522 refrigerators side by side, but no icemaker in either unit. Since the space for the double refrigerator set-up was custom, we got rid of one and spent at least $1600.00 at Lowe's to get one with an icemaker. Now, 4.5 years later, there is a water line leak in the icemaker and we have turned off the water supply while deciding what to do. A service call will be $90.00, and have no idea what the repair cost will be. Even before it broke, it was the slowest icemaker I have ever seen. In essence, we spent 1600 to get an icemaker, and it has ceased to function after 4.5 years. We should have kept the old unit, which was working fine, and just bought ice. On top of the  newer dishwasher from FP needing to be replaced, I cannot recommend this brand EVER.",2016-10-23 00:32:19.000000000,2016,Negative,Fisher Paykel E522BRXU5 ActiveSmart Fridge - 17.6 cu. ft.

B01NBI9JKR,3.0,Received the item damaged - But it works so far.,"Received this item damaged. The outer carton had an impact mark that matched up to the dent. The inner carton was much better, but still had an impact mark on the affected corner. The actual damage to the unit appears to have putty applied to the wound. There didn't seem to be any other visible damage except to the upper back left corner of the unit. I followed the instruction manual to set up the unit to see if it would work... It seems to be operating normally with no coolant leaks or any signs of air leaks from the damage or anywhere else. When setting it up I noted the right front adjustable plastic foot knob is stripped and doesn't hold it level - so I had to put a small rock underneath there to level it. It's been running (quietly) for 24 hrs now and it has frozen a few water bottles. Temperature probe has it at -3.5 degrees F and is set at 4 (1-6). I have a month to decide if it's worth keeping or sending it back for replacement or refund. It's definately not a pretty &#34;new&#34; unit by any stretch - but so far it works.

B0B2WNMD3Z,5.0,First Ice within 5 minutes - large size should fit under upper cabinets,"[[VIDEOID:18a3731b291de304af5afe8d8c2991ee]] The unit is large, heavy and will take up some counter space. It should fit under upper cabinets with couple inches to spare.<br /><br />Per their instructions, after shipping , let it sit in its upright position for 24 hrs. After which, I plugged it in and put water in it. Turned it on and ice started to drop within 5 minutes. After about an hour there was a fair amount of ice, maybe 2/3s full. Hard to say exactly as ice was used during this time.<br /><br />I like the small nuggets it makes. It is a little noisy but not too bad. When you push the dispense button, the auger turns and pushes Ice to the front opening. When you release the button, it reverses the auger for a partial turn which releases pressure on any ice that did not quite fall into your glass. This may also relieve any pressure that might cause a jam. I believe that it auto reverses if it senses a jam. The rate at which it drops the ice into a glass is a little slow, but again not bad. There is a drain hose on the back to empty the reservoir. It can be placed on its bracket to keep it out of the way. The ice box is not insulated so will melt slowly.<br /><br />If you are going to get 40 lbs of ice out of this in a day, you will have to keep emptying the ice bin and toping off the water.",2022-09-01 20:30:56.151999950,2022,Positive,"*****WiFi Connectivity, Machine 40lbs per Day, Portable Self-Cleaning for Smart Home/Kitchen/Office",Industrial & Scientific,

I figured it was most likely the heating element but didn't know how difficult it would be to replace. I found a YouTube video showing how easy it was to remove the lid, control panel and front door for access, so I ordered this part from Amazon and am thrilled I did! I used a multimeter to confirm the bad element and check the thermostats for conductance (they were good). Also, I was quite surprised to find so much dirt inside the dryer housing. It actually took more time to clean the inside of the dryer than to install the part.  In summary, don't be afraid to tackle this job. You only need a Phillips screwdriver and then a pair of pliers to bend a small tab and the two blades of the element wires, plus a vacuum and rag for cleaning. And for a tip, I taped the screws to their respective parts as I disassembled the dryer since each set of screws was different, making for a speedy reassembly.

He replaced a part and then said ""let it thaw, then restart"". So we did.  It still doesn't work!!!  So I called back and they want to send out another tech.  Evidently warranty only means repair.

B07ZTPQQ7P,5.0,Read this before you buy!!!,"So to start off you maybe a bit confused why this product includes both the foils and the silicone disk and filters, basically there are 2 ways to brew and it’s kind of up to you to figure out what works for you, either the foils or the filter/silicone disk way. After testing this, here is my verdict. You don’t need the Filter/silicone disk as this method leaves more mess (inside the machine, no coffee grounds in the cup) it is a longer, more involved option. You want to use the aluminum foils! This is a much easier method since all you need is to fill up the pod with your coffee of choice and seal it with the foil, it works the same way as original, leaves no mess or coffee grounds in your cup and overall the better option since you can make a lot of them and just use them as you wish. The only downside is the foils after reusing them leave glue residue which shortens the life span you can use the pod. The reviews that say foils break and what not are either written by people with defective machine/foils or who simply don’t know how to use their hands. Overall don’t buy this product, instead go and buy my-cup 100q foils as it is cheaper and you will come to the same conclusion regardless.",2020-01-14 16:42:16.579999924,2020,Positive,My-Cap Sampler - Complete Solution to Make Your Own Capsules for Nespresso VertuoLine Brewers (Combo),Amazon Home,$19.99

If this doesn't get through Amazon's liability filter then you're on your own.<br /><br />The Frigidaire machine in the video appears to be identical to my GE washer, inside and out.  Even the screws and dimples on the sheet metal back panel are exactly the same.  The video recommends using a deep-well socket to slip over the end of the mounting pin to depress the retaining tab (the tab prevents the pin from backing out).  I found it quite easy to rotate the pin around with pliers, positioning the tab where I could reach it with my free hand, and then press the tab down with a finger.  This saves removing the air separator as shown in the video.  The pins are a tight fit -- took a firm pull to get the old ones out, and tapping with a wood block and hammer to get the new ones in.  Still, it's an easy repair.<br /><br />I've had these shocks in for about a week and the machine is running like new.  Can't say how long they will last, but so far so good.",2016-09-07 16:45:19.000000000,2016,Positive,Supco LP5917 Washer Shock Kit,Appliances,$22.95

B013XXTFKG,5.0,VERY COOL (no pun intended),"I ordered this ice maker on thursday and recieved it on tuesday. great shipping. Followed instructions and it produced ice in 10 min, and 6 min for each 9 cubes. Ice gets larger after each cycle and fills basket in about an hour.The unit is very quiet, You only hear the ice placed in the basket.I t seems that other brands are the same as the Koldfront but are just a little larger and more expensive (avalon bay, igloo etc). Size is  important because is will be  used in my rv and counter space is limited. I think the poor reviews are from people that are too critical. As far as this ice maker  goes it met my expectations.  Highly recommended . I searched on the internet for hours and decided on this ice maker. Happy with this choice.. I think you will agree.  I also purchased a two year extended warranty. You can be never too careful.

I don't give it 5 stars because this is the 3rd machine I have purchased in 2 years. BUY THE SERVICE PLAN! The first machine, the gears stripped, they are made of plastic so do no over wind the dials. The second one, the spinner quit working and I did not hear back from the manufacturer after asking if it could be fixed. I figure one month at the laundry mat costs me $80.00 so the machine pays for itself after only 2 months, but I do wish it were made a little better. You can't beat the performance though. My clothes get very clean, actually cleaner than a full sized machine. Clothes dry quickly as the spinner takes out most of the water. LOVE this machine but wish it would last for more than one year. Update 11/17 - My 3rd machine has stopped working, again the spinner is failing to move. The water pump still works. The washers water jets will not work enough to do a counter clock wise spin.

B004IBO70Q,2.0,Not what we wanted,"We bought this to sit on our bar in our home to dispense ice whenever we wanted it instead of running back and forth to the kitchen for ice. There are several problems: 1) extremely noisy - the thing sounds like some one is building a Buick literally continuously. 2) the cubes are only barely frozen and melt VERY rapidly (although they are adorably small and cute) 3) the machine is not made to sit there continuously making and dispensing ice. We did not realize till we set it up (and threw away the boxes and packaging - shame on us) that it's meant to make ice and then be shut off. At the back of the instruction manual it says you shouldn't let it sit there turned on with ice in it and that it's meant to make some ice and then be shut off. This makes no sense whatsoever. If it's just going to make some ice that you then have to store in the freezer, then why wouldn't you just buy a bag of ice for $2 and store THAT in the freezer? We bought this so we had an ice maker in our bar area so we could get ice anytime we wanted, all the time. This is the dumbest product ever. I wouldn't mind so much if it was $10 but it was expensive and really a stupid design for a tabletop icemaker.",2013-01-13 15:26:39.000000000,2013,Negative,Avanti IMD250 - Portable Counter Top Icemaker / Dispenser,Appliances,

Called Frigidaire customer service on 9/28/21,  got a technician to come by within one day (good) to check it. He said that the main computer of the cooktop was defective, not working. He will order the part. I received a text message from the technician company on 10/11/21 that the part was on back order no ETA. I called Frigidaire customer service on 10/15/21, still waiting for the part to come, to call back in 10 business days. Today 10/29/21 I called Frigidaire customer service and they said they will call the technician service company to find out what part are they waiting for, after a few minutes the customer service rep gave me the part order number and said she just order the part and will be shipped to me on 11/17/21, that I will received it in 2-3 business days after that day, after receiving the part to call them back to set up an appointment with the technician to come and install it for us. So far, bought this brand new cooktop, it will be at least 3 months since we bought it and had not been able to use it!  No cooking in our brand new remodeled kitchen for all this time!! This part of the review (the purchase), I would say, do not buy this brand/model.... I will re-visit my review after I receive the part and the technician comes and try to make it work, we will see..... Well, as I expected, it si now 12/6/21, and no solution for us. No cooktop, no part, no replacement unit as I requested last time I called Customer Service on 11/24/21. On that day the Rep said it will take 5 business days to get an answer from the supervisor or next higher up in the chain.... toady I call back because I did not get a call or email from anybody about the request to get a replacement since its been over 2 months since we bought this mistake! Now I have to wait up tp 7 business days to get an answer if Frigidaire will send me a replacement or not.... I really don't know how to say this but DO NOT BUY this cooktop model. The model as far as me, its not good, and their Customer Service only take messages.... Today's rep said that there was no record of my 11/24/21 call about a replacement.... Its beyond comprehension, that means that we can't even trust a reputable brand name company to help their customers, in other words, the rep never wrote down in my file about this replacement request and lied about it, This is too much!!

The 5 stars rating remains accurate insofar as our experience is concerned.  We've had zero problems with this product.  It's super quiet.  Keeps food consistently cold.  And, for us at least, the ice maker works well.<br /><br />EDIT (3/27/13) Still lovin' the fridge.  Zero problems.  Quiet.  Nice.<br /><br />Edit (2/9/14) Going on 5 years now, and absolutely no trouble.  Sorry to read about some of the problems others have experienced.  Maybe we just got lucky.

Checkout Amazon item B000CDAFE6; Fantech RSK 4 Backdraft Damper 4&#34; Duct.  Also recommended.<br />It may be helpful to add that I used a foam sealant on both sides of the wall (similar to B0013IZSPU; which works like caulk, but expands a little to fill in cracks and gaps, and is supposed to be waterproof).  Since this Vent Hood includes a collar for inside the wall, I used extra sealant (just let it seep out as I pushed the collar tight against the wall), and cleaned around the edges to have an air-tight, waterproof installation.",2014-05-06 14:13:06.000000000,2014,Positive,"Deflecto Dryer Vent, Wide Mouth Galvanized Vent Hood with Pipe, Silver, 4” (GVH4NR) , GRAY",Appliances,$20.50

B000BPNLM8,5.0,Works as advertised,"The reason I feel compelled to comment on this filter is because of my own ignorance.<br /><br />Let me explain. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that the filter over our stove (which had been in place for at least 14 years) looked and felt like something  you'd find on the beach after boat accident and a major oil spill. Thinking the filter was an irreplaceable component of the range hood, I began soaking and cleaning it and carefully scrubbing the muck off. I'd let it dry, realize it still felt like a gunky scratchy mess and go at it again.  After a day or two of this a light bulb went off and it occurred to me that the dang thing might actually be REPLACEABLE! So I came to Amazon (of course) and (of course) found a replacement here. It arrived and fit perfectly. So this quantum leap in knowledge may be inflating my grade, but this item from Broan fits and it works and I was very happy to toss its predecessor. Could I have found one of these babies at a hardware store at a lower cost? Maybe so -- but probably wouldn't have remembered to go looking for one. I am once again thrilled with the selection and ease of purchasing that Amazon affords me.",2014-06-28 01:01:01.000000000,2014,Positive,"Broan BP57 Aluminum Filter With Light Lens for 43000 Series Range Hood, 11-3/8 x 11-3/4-Inch",Tools & Home Improvement,$13.99

B005OW0TTG,5.0,Think before you buy!,"Purchased this model from another vendor.  All the good things said about this machine are true and I can attest to that.  One other nice feature I find with this machine is while it is filling with water, you can rinse out those goofy plastic measuring cups that come with your liquid laundry detergents by placing the cup under the cascading waterfall entering the tub.  No more yucky goooy plastic measuring cups.  This means that you CAN OPEN THE COVER while the tub is filling with water.  No LOCKING lid to aggravate you to no end.  Other washing machines at the big box stores are there only to fill up our land fills with more junk.  Most of the new machines have electronic circuit boards that will end up in our land fills and leach all kinds of lead and harmful chemicals into our ground.  I swear foreign manufacturers have no care about how we are going to dispose of all these pieces of junk they are sending over to our country.  Speed Queen is MADE IN THE USA with American labor and American parts.  The electric controls in this machine less of a hazard to our landfills than circuit boards do and since the SQ is designed to last, there will be less of them ending up in our landfills.

I swapped out the motor with this replacement (slightly frustrating process, but not impossible) and everything was gravy.  I'm not an expert, but I think the problem was a little spring connecting two parts of the motor.

I have a whirlpool DW and the motor is in front, search youtube on how to install, there is a little clip you push down on and do a 1/4 turn and it pulls off easy. Remove wire clasp, then do reverse for new motor, but search for video to see where clip is that needs to be pressed.<br /><br />Turn off Elec at breaker first!!! and put towel under the DW to catch excess water and remove drain hose with pliers. Try and get all as much as possible of the water out before removing the hose.<br /><br />My DW would not drain when needed while in use, everything was hot and you could smell a faint elec smell of an overworked motor, but the motor would work if I turned the DW off and let the water and motor cool to room temp, then clicked cancel button till drain lit up, then closed door and it would drain. I though I had a clog somewhere at first.

B07DPG6JKZ,5.0,Identical to Original,"These are a factory match at over 40% less than OEM GE prices.  All knobs (factory or aftermarket) for my GE gas stove top are plastic.  So they will break in due time.  I got about 10 years out of 4 of the 6 OEM GE knobs.  Then they crack around the center stem on the underside of the knob which is to be expected eventually.  For longer life, ensure you push down firmly on the knob BEFORE you turn it.  Not pressing down hard enough puts pressure on the ""barrel"" portion and will lead to cracking.  When you do remove your present knobs, ensure the METAL INSERT installed in the middle of the ""barrel hole"" on the underside of the knob comes off with the knob.  But since 4 of my knobs had a crack in the ""barrel"" portion of the knob, the metal insert stayed on the gas control valve peg on the stove.  So when my wife first tried to install the new knobs, she said they would not go down on the peg.  But I noted the metal insert from the old knob was still on the peg (which it will do if the old knob's barrel portion is cracked).  So I merely lifted the old metal insert off the peg with my fingers, and installed the new knobs just fine.  Obviously the new knobs have the metal inserts preinstalled, and if the knob barrel does not crack, then the metal insert will stay attached inside that hole on the underside of the knob.  The new knobs when pushed down fit nice and tight and drop down just as far as the OEM GE knobs.  I have confidence these knobs will last a long time and for the price, would buy again and again.",2018-12-02 00:49:06.075999975,2018,Positive,BlueStars Heavy Duty WB03T10325 Range Metal Knob Replacement Part Exact Fit for General Electric Ranges - Replaces 2691864 AP5690210 PS3510510 - Pack of 2,Tools & Home Improvement,$14.95

B07MLWJZH7,2.0,Your only getting $70 worth.,"If anyone thinks they are gonna wash clothes with this on a daily basis to survive....riiiight, haha. It’s almost a kids toy. I bought one to wash my microfiber car detailing rags. I wash about 10 each 12” x12”rags at a time. It actually washes really good but forget the spin portion. It’s a flimsy, low grade, plastic  design and spins so slow, shakes and wobbles UNLESS you get the items perfectly balanced in that tiny little smurf basket, haha. This machine needs no additional help to break itself. You can rinse the rags out way better just by wringing them out. The electric motor gets very hot washing only 8-10 Microfiber rags with 2.0 gal of water at 6 min. This company knows they are selling low grade products, but then again it’s only $70 and I was crazy enough to buy it. It will serve my needs for a few (washes only) I’m sure. But honestly, if it lasts one month using it daily I’ll be surprised. When it does I’ll toss it in the dumpster and  lesson learned. It “could be” a great unit, but it needs some serious beefing up.

When it’s making ice it can be load but not louder than a standard dishwasher. The quality of the maker itself is really nice and clean looking. It’s a definite benefit to get the side water tank but not a necessity. The ice it produces is simply amazing. It’s an ice maker to make all other ice makers jealous.

B08BPDTL1H,2.0,DRAIN THE WATER INTO THE TOILET!,"Update June 19, 2021 - My machine came with a card promising to ship me the new version, free of charge, once it came out. I have been trying to get in touch with the company. They seemed to have no problems answering me when they wanted my review. Now, nothing. Generation Traders, the original seller, changed their name so they don't have to be responsible for my purchase. This is typical in various industries. Did anyone else get this card?<br /><br />Update February 10, 2021 - I see the new photo of the ""upgraded"" machine. It seems the only change is in the lids of the wash and spin tubs and the knobs. Purely cosmetic. They did not add a water inlet hole into the spin dry side, like all of the other brands have at this comparable price. For that, I am reducing my star count to 3.<br /><br />Review - January 11, 2021 -<br /><br />I am very impressed with this washer. My clothes come out very clean. Since I never totally dry my clothes when using a traditional dryer, the spinner fits my needs. As someone who has worked in the textile industry for 40 years, I do have suggestions about using it -<br />1 - THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW - Let it drain into the toilet, not the sink or shower. Detergent and fibers mix to become a gluey sludge and it WILL clog them.<br />2 - A water spout into the spinner would be nice to rinse the clothes more efficiently. I hope the company fixes that.<br />3 - I have never needed more than 6 minutes to wash or 2 minutes to spin. 15 minute washings could be too harsh on your clothes.<br />4 - The rotation can be hard on the clothes and get them quite tangled and pull on sleeves.<br />5 - I always use the SOFT setting but the only difference between that and the NORMAL is it delays an extra second or 2 between rotations. The rotations on SOFT should be about 50% slower than the NORMAL setting. That is another issue I hope the company fixes.<br />6 - Half loads work much better than full loads. It can throw off the balance of the machine and make it stall.<br />7 - When you hang your laundry to dry, put on a fan. It will dry much faster and smell fresher if the water is not left to sit in the clothes.<br />8 - The instructions packaged with this machine are CRAP! Please watch YouTube videos to learn. All of these machines work the same way.<br /><br />I greatly thank all the ladies who published videos on YouTube to give me a heads up about how these machines work. It made it all so much easier.",2021-01-11 05:23:00.243999958,2021,Negative,"Garatic Portable Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine w/Wash and Spin Cycle, Built-in Gravity Drain, 13lbs Capacity For Camping, Apartments, Dorms, College Rooms, RV’s, Delicates and more",Appliances,$169.99

Right away I suspected the clutch (again) which I just replaced about a year ago for the same problem. But after pulling the machine out and seeing all the nasty gear-oil all over the floor, I knew exactly what was causing the problem... the transmission input shaft seal has failed and (obviously) leaking.<br /><br />What happens on these direct drive washers is when the transmission (or gearbox) input seal leaks, it will sling oil up and saturate the clutch-pack assembly causing it to slip. And when the clutch slips, this will prevent your wash tub from spinning (our it will spin real slow). Luckily I got to mine soon enough and was able to remove the clutch pack, clean the oil from the shoes and drum and reinstall it after replacing the input seal. I just rechecked the new seal install recently and the floor under my washer is dry and oil-free. And the machine spins normal again.<br />Happy with my purchase",2021-08-24 22:11:07.440999985,2021,Positive,REPLACEMENTKITS.COM - Gearcase Input Seal Equivent to Whirlpool 285352 & W10111745 -,Appliances,$13.50

B0178O1CQ6,5.0,It works just as great as it looks!,"I was renovating my kitchen and needed a new ""island"" range hood.  The previous vent hood that I had was only good from one side.  I saw this one and it looked perfect.  Rest assured that what you see is what you get - only it looks even better in my kitchen (see picture).<br />Sadly, I cannot give you many installation tips, because I had an expert installer put it in for me, who was an expert in all of the ""trades"", but I did watch and help a little.  The end result was more beautiful than I imagined. He did mention that the installation manual was vague, the picture on front didn't even match my model, and I think the instructions say to mount it to the sheetrock - which we didn't think was nearly sturdy enough.  It's a heavy, steel piece, so we came up with a new plan.  He built a wood box frame, with the thickness of three 2""x4""'s, and secured that in my attic, and attached my new range hood to it.  I could practically swing from it, now (but don't try that at home).  We also used almost all of our own screws - with the renovation going on, I had plenty of additional hardware and tools on hand.<br />Because my ceiling was lower (8ft) in the kitchen, our unit didn't need such a long ""neck"" - but the 2 steel rectangular sleeves that come with it are meant to be ""nested"", so we had to cut both pieces almost in half but, because my installer was an expert, he made it look great - as you can see by the picture!<br />If you must have something blocking your newly opened view (we tore down a wall, between the kitchen and living room), then it should be this beauty!<br />It has 4 well-placed lights, one on each corner, for ""full food disclosure"" - it really lights up my stove top!.  As a personal preference, I've already replaced my little lights with the LED white light version of the bulbs, because I like more white light and less yellow light - purely my choice - but I wanted people to know that replacement bulbs are easy to find.  I bought them right off the shelf at my local hardware store, in the specialty lighting area.<br />All 4 speed settings of the fan work great and, of course, the higher the setting, the noisier the fan - but the more vacuum power you'll get, for getting rid of the smoke (not that I ever burn anything)(maybe once or twice) (a month).  The lower speeds are pretty quiet compared to my old ""hoody"".<br />My old vent hood had knobs and it had 3 speeds, 1). noisy, 2). super noisy, 3). noisiest...I SAID NOISIEST!<br />This one is a touchscreen and I really like it.  It looks super clean and modern and it is everything I expected and more.

Unfortunately, I didn't know there was debris inside the line until I tried to run the in-door water dispenser. It was easy to pull the water inlet valve from our 20 year old Kenmore. Don't pay a service person to do this! I simply entered the part number found on the label, compared it visually to images on the www and found a replacement. The shroud was a little different from the original, but the water inlet and outlets and mounting holes were the same (extremely important). A ton of extra fittings were provided with the valve. I just used the new parts needed and tossed the rest. This valve was priced differently thru several web sites. Do your research and save some $. Shipping was prompt, the water dispenser works, the wife is happy, I'm happy.",2017-11-06 21:12:21.953999996,2017,Positive,Whirlpool W10498990 Water Inlet,Tools & Home Improvement,$63.29

The machine spends most of the first 10 minutes of its ice making cycle trickling water over the top of the clear plastic drawer.

I found YouTube instructions for taking out the racks and other components necessary to get at the chopper blade and discovered that, indeed, the blade part was no longer attached and the little compartment where the blade fits was filled with stuff that had accumulated and could no longer be chopped up and flushed out. So for a relatively simple repair procedure to replace the chopper blade, I have a dishwasher that cleans like new again. Yay!

However, after installing the anti-vibration pads, I've run a few washes in the problematic cycles and there has been much less vibration. My test: drink on floor in front of washer. Liquid surface & glass were not affected. Drink on top of washer merrily vibrated down to one corner.<br /><br />My washer is a Maytag Bravos XL. I hate it because I want the ability to fine tune a wash - preset buttons suck - sometimes you NEED more water. However, a front loader wouldn't have any less vibration (researched that) and I can, at least, leave the lid up so I don't get stinky mildew odors.",2017-11-30 02:37:54.290999889,2017,Positive,Washer anti vibration anti walking pads,Appliances,

I have to admit that when it was first installed that it was absolutely quiet and worked great. The price is reasonable and the items that comes within the kit is all you need to put it together. However, after 2 months of use, the washing machine sounds like the bearings are once again starting to fail.  Doing this repair  is relatively easy but it's very time-consuming. Note that there are alot of YouTube videos to help and if you clean the drum like I did, pretty messy. I recommend using a pressure washer in doing so. I happened to loan mine out to my brother in law at the time, but I digress. Now I'm pretty disappointed that it failed. Personally knowing how durable bearings are or should be I'm going to assume this is a one-off or like others refer to as an outlier and try this product again. I'm also trying this product again because it's also relatively inexpensive.

B012P95E5E,5.0,So far so good,"I'm using this for my clothes washing machine. I will be replacing it with a more modern one soon and I wanted additional protection. My home's electrical panel doesn't have any free circuit spaces for a whole home surge protector and this one mentions power-back surge protection. Not exactly sure how that works, but it sounds good and I have some thoughts as to how a device like this could help with that. Prior to using this, most of the time when I would start my clothes washer, an ev charger which is on it's own circuit, but of course shares the same grounding system, would have it's GFI protection kick in. That's the only time it would. The outlet and circuit for the clothes washer (and the ev charger) are wired correctly. The only down side is for this product is that it' blocks not only outlets above or below it, but next to it. Meaning I can't have the gas dryer which uses a normal 15/20A 110V outlet plugged in at the same time. I was thinking of adding a separate electrical gang box and outlet for the dryer anyway, so I will make it work, but others could run into this problem.<br /><br />Update Jan 7 2019: The original intent of me purchasing this has been satisfied completely. With it in place, the EV charger no longer triggers a fault. In addition, there was an electric company issue in the neighborhood a week ago where we had a brownout - voltage dropped to 105 volts and sometimes down to 94 volts. This unit indicated undervoltage and stopped the electric supply to the washing machine - thus protecting it.",2018-11-01 01:01:11.967999935,2018,Positive,"APPLIANCE SHIELD Surge Protector - Protects Appliances From Damaging & Costly Voltage Spikes/Dips, Works Great for Appliances, Refrigerators, Freezers, Dryers.

The rubber ring is removable and you can wash the actual filter as much as you need to (I mainly handwash it). While I'm still trying to fine tune my coffee grind, it is currently between Medium and Coarse settings. I think I can grind it a little more towards the Medium and still be fine with it. The coffee brewed is strong as the hot water soaks through the grind so no issues with the filter letting too much water pass through it too, as the mesh is quite fine and porous enough without letting a flood of water through. Save the trees and get this. Well worth it.

B07V43DPVY,1.0,Ejecting is the only thing this does right,"I bought this pod and a similar one from another brand name. Both were identical so I'm assuming that they all come from the same place in China. The actual quality is impressive but that is a s far as it goes. Loading the pod is easy, Ieven bought a tamper to help. However the amount of actual liquid coffee that came out was just a dribble. I tried different grinds, different amounts of grounds, still all that came out was about a tablespoon of liquid. the actual stainless steel pod is about the size of the Alto (14 fl. oz)  but what comes out is substantially less that the Nespresso Espresso pod (1.35 floz). I was lucky to get half that in many attempts. The machine gets the level from the codes on the rim of the pods. Both of these stainless pods (different venters) use the code for Mug (7.7 fl oz). The only thing I can think that could improve is the sharpness of the code lines. The Nespresso pod code is very distinct (and in black) whereas the stainless had some smudging along the code lines (and was in brown). I used lens cleaner to reduce the smudging and sharpen the lines and it worked a little bit. I was able to get roughly 1.7 fl oz from the stainless pods. With regular pods you can simply push the button and continue filling your cup. With the stainless the machine stopped after the button was pushed.<br />But as the title says, the ejection process was just as good with the stainless as with the pods.",2019-09-07 01:23:51.719000101,2019,Negative,"Stainless Steel Refillable Coffee Pods Compatible for Nespresso VertuoPlus,Stainless Steel Reusable Coffee Capsules Pods (2.4 oz)",Amazon Home,$26.99

B0912KK8Z8,4.0,Works better than just a fan.,"With temperatures hitting 100+ already we were looking for a way to cool down a little more. This has helped, but don't expect too much of it.<br /><br />First thing you should know since we almost missed this: once the fan is turned on via the knob, you have to PRESS the knob to get the mist going. The documentation wasn't terribly helpful in this regard.<br /><br />So let me tell you exactly what this is: this is a fan with an ultrasonic diffusing plate in front of it that turns the water into vapor. It's basically an essential oil diffuser put in front of a fan. (Though I would NOT try putting oil in it.) But that gives you an idea of how much mist we're talking about. I expected the pads in the louvers to get wet when using it (they don't) or at least the pad in the bottom to catch anything that drips. (This doesn't seem to get wet either.) The resulting effect is that it does cool off ever so slightly more than a fan does, but it's basically something you're going to just want to put on your desk right in front of you. In that regard it does OK.<br /><br />We went the extra mile and used a spray bottle to wet down the louver pads a bit and that helped. (Make sure you take the louver/grill off before you do this so you don't spray water into the fan motor itself.)<br /><br />Honestly, for the price one can't really expect too much from something this size. We found the fan speeds adequate, and the mister does help somewhat, so it fundamentally does what it's supposed to. It's not going to cool you off like a proper swamp cooler or A/C, but for something that sits on your desk and helps you stay a little cooler during this roasting months, it DOES help.",2022-06-13 04:06:31.157000065,2022,Positive,CXhome Portable Air Conditioner Fan Evaporative Air Cooler 3-in-1 Air Humidifier 3 Speeds & RGB Gradient Colour USB Retro Radio Style for Room Office Travel,Appliances,

B0032N3L58,4.0,Stylish and sleek,"Stylish and sleek is my first response, the stainless steel matte finish on glass would go nice in any kitchen, the fan works superbly at all three speeds, and though it's not the quietest fan, it certainly isn't the loudest. The four LED lights although not as bright as I expected (not bright enough to cook by) does cast a soft glow in the dark and serves as a decent night light. Because this range vent has an adjustable height setting it can work with most ceiling heights, personally I preferred to install the vent at a height just above the top of my head so it wouldn't interfere with the view of the living room, and this required some modifications (cutting down) of the stainless steel. Overall, at almost half the cost of comparable range vents, I am very pleased with the finish product.

B01ARKY31O,5.0,Fixed our warm fridge problem!,"Seller: BUDORA DIRECT<br /><br />Part seems genuine and price wasn't so cheap it makes me question whether or not it was a fake knock-off.<br /><br />Samsung fridge model: RF18HFENBWW (this part probably fits other models as well)<br /><br />The bad news is this is a SUPER common problem with Samsung fridges. It's most likely not IF but WHEN you'll encounter this issue (took about 5 years for us). The good news is it's cheap and easy to fix yourself if you're even remotely DIY inclined. One tech also told me that he almost never sees other issues (than this one) with Samsung fridges, so that's promising.<br /><br />Our Samsung fridge was too warm and the freezer too cold. A professional tech came out and diagnosed our fridge and said this part would fix it (he was kind enough to just charge for the service call and gave me the part number). Our fridge was also icing up in the evaporator (which is behind the large plastic cover in the back, our cover says Twin Cooling on it). How he determined the problem was with the temp sensor and not some part of the defrost system, I dunno.<br /><br />Ideally you will probably also want to replace the large plastic evaporator cover as well, part #DA97-11823A. I found it much cheaper elsewhere. It's an expensive part, so if you want to save a few bucks, you might try removing it first to inspect it. You want to make sure that the styrofoam is still all intact and doesn't have any mold/mildew growing on it. Ours had some mold growing on it (due to ice build-up), which is pretty much impossible to eradicate from styrofoam, because it's porous. You don't want funk being fan-circulated all over your food. And if the styrofoam has been damaged (either during the removal process or by ice build-up), then the cold air won't get circulated properly throughout your fridge.<br /><br />The replacement is pretty easy. Search on  youtube for a how-to video. Here's what I did:<br /><br />1. turn off the breaker and empty fridge and freezer completely leave all doors open to defrost<br />2. wait 24 hours<br />3. remove all shelves and drawers in the fridge<br />4. use a phillips #2 to remove three screws: two are at the bottom of the evap cover and one is just above middle of the cover, you need to pry out the plastic cover to access the screw<br />5. use a butter knife or paint scraper to press in the tabs on the sides of the cover. Use your fingers to help pull the tabs free to loosen the cover. Most of the tabs have a tiny arrow pointing to them, but two of them are unmarked near the top. Ours had 8 tabs in all, 4 on each side.<br />6. At this point, the cover might fall free, so be sure to have firm grip on it and don't let it drop. There are some short wires connected in the back and you don't want to rip them out.<br />7.  You might take a photo at this point of the wires connected in the back.<br />8. Squeeze the connectors to remove the wires that are connected to the cover.<br />9. the temp sensor is connected on the top left, the lower and smaller of the two connectors.<br />10. cut the 2 or 3 zip ties<br />11. Disconnect the temp sensor connector on the left. Ours had some plastic cover things over the wire connectors that had to be removed first. They don't seem essential, so if you break them when removing, probably not a big deal.<br />12. Remove the actual sensor from the plastic cage it's in that's attached to a refrigerator copper line.<br />13. Replace the old sensor with the new one.<br />14. Re-assemble in reverse order.<br />15. Turn breaker back on. Ours took several hours to get back down to temperature but works like a charm now.",2021-12-14 18:24:51.204999924,2021,Positive,Samsung DA32-00024W Temperature Sensor,Tools & Home Improvement,$15.16

B07QFPKG9V,5.0,Wii add years to the life of your front loading washer,"I installed the pads months ago, but held back on the review until I was certain they worked.  These vibration pads are fantastic.  They dampen and attenuate drum vibration as advertised.  Before using them, washing a load of towels caused the drum of my washer to slam against the interior of the washer cabinet with the sound of sledge hammers.  The washer would “walk” a few feet while this was happening, which is dangerous because it could pull against and damage the water supply hoses and produce flooding.<br /><br />After installation, you can barely hear the washer operating.  Drum vibration was greatly damped, and the pads have an additional benefit.  Moving my heavy washer was a big ordeal without the pads, now I can easiLy slide the washer out of the way when I need access behind it, and no more washer crawling.<br />The level was very useful during pad installation, and the leveling feet of the washer were easy to adjust when they were sitting on top of the pads.<br /><br />The pads are the best investment you could possibly make for your front loading washer.  No banging of the drum means less wear and tear on the drum bearings.

So it was stuck in a non-boot limbo.<br /><br />I soldered on a 220k resistor between GPIO2 and VCC, and now the ESP-01 boots when plugged into the temp sensor module.<br /><br />The included soldered-on DHT11 temp module is far from great.  It regularly reports a WAY out of range temperature and/or humidity that I have to filter out.<br />And the case for the DHT11 temp sensor looks... melted.  I suspect it subjected to a temperature way outside of its boundaries when soldered on the module.<br /><br />The voltage regulator built into the module seems fine, and the 8-pin female socket seems to make good contact with the pins.<br />I will probably desolder the ncluded DHT11 and add my own alternative temperature sensor to replace it (with the appropriate pull-up resistor so it will actually boot).",2020-07-02 04:10:20.802999973,2020,Negative,WINGONEER ESP8266 ESP-01S Serial Wireless Transceiver+DHT11 Temperature Humidity Monitor Shield Sensor WiFi Module Adapter Board,Amazon Home,

B01BHUSQZ2,2.0,Performance drops sharply after a short time.  Disappointing.,"This filter unfortunately does not seem to perform as advertised.  While there is a lot to like about it, it only offers trade-offs over current filters on the market.  Ultimately it's more of a hassle over traditional filters.<br /><br />Setup and activation of the filter is a process.  There are a number of components that need to be washed and assembled.  The filter needs to be soaked for some time, and due to the fact that the filter tends to float, I spent the time to hold it under the water to ensure a complete activation.  It never actually stayed submerged during this process.  The final step is shaking the filter.<br /><br />Once assembled, it performed nicely for a few days.  I could leave the pitcher in the sink to fill up under a moderate stream and it would only take a minute or so.  The performance quickly dropped, however.  Now it takes a few minutes to fill up under only a trickle.  Any faster and the reservoir on top overflows and leaks into the filtered water.  It seems like a step backward.<br /><br />The other filters on the market that have a more thorough filter and a larger reservoir actually perform better.  You can fill up your water bottle from the pitcher, then fill up the pitcher reservoir walk away.  With this, you have to stand there waiting for it to fill.  It's a step backward.  And the fact that the filter on this product is only a fraction of the filtering capability of others doesn't really help.<br /><br />I was puzzled that the throughput of the filter fell off so steeply after such a short time.  They are supposed to last 3 months, but I only got a week or so before the throughput dropped.  I thought maybe the filter had frozen so I left it out of the fridge for a while.  That didn't help.  I guess the water could be so loaded with particulates that it clogged up the filter really quickly, but that seems unlikely.<br /><br />There are some other gimmicks to this product like being able to easily remove the filter to fill up a pot of water or a water bottle, but it performs so poorly that simply filling from the pitcher is the most efficient.<br /><br />I do like the look of the pitcher and it is easy to hold and use.  Unfortunately, the performance is just so bad that I can't really recommend this product.",2016-04-20 19:41:51.000000000,2016,Negative,EveryDrop by Whirlpool Water DBPIT2M1 PopOut Pitcher System,Tools & Home Improvement,

B00LIAP2ZY,5.0,Love this big workhorse,"I always wondered as a kid why such a machine didn't exist. Then I learned Europeans have been using them since before I was born.<br /><br />My husband and I moved cross country sight-unseen into what is surely the world's smallest studio apartment with the largest price tag, chosen blindly simply FOR the fact it had in-unit laundry, in some brand-new modern building with fancy countertops and pretty appliances and a polished concrete floor and all things not at all our style, and we survived over three years of living in approximately 120 usable square feet largely thanks to this machine's baby brother, which was small enough to fit under the kitchen counter and quiet enough to run while on teleconferences working from home which in that place meant sitting about four feet away from the machine. (This bigger model however is too tall to fit under a kitchen counter)<br /><br />We're not picky about our laundry: you'd never find us separating our lights from darks, therefore we used the same setting nearly every time, so this machine serves an extra purpose still: it's the laundry hamper, too! More space saved in that tiny apartment!! (Space planning was a really big deal for my sanity. There were NO CLOSETS. My husband's clothes were folded and stored next to our dinner plates n bowls. My clothes were folded and stored in the bedside table's drawer, and that table doubled as the dinner table. We each owned four outfits.)<br /><br />Then finally, precisely three years, two months and five days later, we'd scrimped and saved enough to trade one absolutely ridiculous living situation for an equally ridiculous but opposite one, and bought the biggest fixer of an old house you've ever seen (just look at that lean in my photo!: the washer-dryer combo machine is perfectly level). On moving day as I looked around that stupidly small now-empty apartment I realized I would miss absolutely nothing except for that washer-dryer combo machine (and the hot tub on the roof, fine.). So on our first night in our new-old junker of a gigantic house, I took our mattress out of the bag (pro tip from having moved sooooo many times: first make your bed --pillows, sheets, comforter and all-- THEN put it in the mattress bag, and use packing tape to wrap it twice super tight so your made bed stays intact, and then BOOM on the other end of your move all you need to do is rip it open), flopped down, got out my phone, immediately ordered this bigger brother from the amazon app, and there it was about two weeks later. It had shipped from Minnesota via a freight company, but then had to transfer from presumably a semi to a smaller truck once closer to the city because our ridiculous house is on a ridiculous hill, a 28.6% grade. (Do a Google image search for ""San Francisco stuck truck"" and you will understand - I witness this at least once a month) Still, the machine made it here and the beefy shipping guys somehow brought it in (it is HEAVY) and navigated it all the way back through twisty hallways and stairs in strange places to its final resting place at the very back of the house, and placed it on the platform I had built for it while in transit to keep it level in The House With No Level Surfaces, and on its rough voyage it only sustained one teeny scratch that was easily touched up (not that it was even necessary; the machine already stood out like a sore thumb as the only new thing).<br /><br />Like its smaller version, this one works just the same and has a few modes I still haven't tried after two years and two days of ownership. The house already had enough plumbing backup issues so we made a quick greywater system to water a gorgeous Japanese maple in the backyard, and I think in doing so actually fixes the lone problem we'd had with our apartment's smaller machine; sometimes it would clog (that 0E error message another reviewer mentions) since the lint drains out with the water. Even though I'd run the former washer empty and clean the lint trap regularly that error message made a frequent appearance on the smaller machine. In our lazy greywater setup, I used an existing dryer vent hole through which I put the machine's hose, attaching it to a long garden hose & securing it with foil tape. Then the garden hose drops right off the deck and through some PVC pipe to direct it diagonally across the yard to the tree, where it lands a few feet above the ground, some 20' down. I wonder if the long drop has anything to do with lint not having a chance to build up anywhere. I find I don't have to clean the tub or lint trap nearly as often as with the other, too. I took the tape off a couple times the first year and checked then reapplied to make sure there was no mold building up, no strange smells, and all seems fine. I find with this machine I do have to level it after every few loads (I'd much rather clean the lint trap more instead; did I mention how HEAVY this machine is), but I'm sure most of that has to do with the jankiness of the house and is not the fault of the spin cycle. You can certainly feel the spin cycle from any point in the house -- again, I'm attributing this entirely to the house. And teleconferences are still OK from home because even though this machine's louder, my home office (twice the size of our entire former apartment) is on a different floor and farrrrrr away from the laundry room.<br /><br />I think the smaller model served our purposes well in the small apartment with four outfits apiece, and I think the larger one serves us best in our situation now. While I think we still may only have four outfits each, we go through SO many work rags n towels from our remodel. I think any family larger than 1 might find the smaller model too small and would probably prefer this one. I hooked it up to a smart plug for a few weeks to see what it cost to run and while I can't remember the exact usage, I recall being shocked at how little energy it used. Oh, and before leaving a bad review for a cycle taking 6 hours, remember how big the tub was on your last washer, and how much larger the dryer tub was, and ask yourself if it could be user error. :) The clothes need room to fling about in order to dry! Don't crowd the machine! You'll know you're crowding the machine if things are more wrinkled than you'd expect right when a load finishes. Even loads with only towels (and I splurged on big white fluffy bath towels) doesn't take longer than two and a half hours or so and nothing ever comes out remotely damp. If 2.5 hours is still annoyingly long for you, then set the thing to start on a delay (which is a feature it has! and I love!) to start in a few hours, go to work, and come home just as it's finishing up to warm dry wrinkle-free clothes. In our house of neverending renovating work, this machine makes my life soooooo much sweeter. The only thing this washer-dryer combo machine could possibly do better is bring the clothes upstairs and put them on hangers in the CLOSETS we now have, and then pour me a glass of wine. :)",2018-08-19 03:27:44.658999920,2018,Positive,"LG WM3997HWA Ventless 4.3 Cu.

I start by filling it with some hot water and soap, then add in the laundry and run it. I use my spin dryer to wring them out and put them back in for a rinse (or second wash), then spin dry them again and hang them up to dry. I fixed my problem with the hose by attaching the &#34;sink/fill&#34; hose to the drain hose so that water didn't spill out of the hose while it was running.

For this reason, I absolutely need a hood that would be unobtrusive and not class with my appliance.<br />I am extremely pleased at how low the profile of this hood is and how unobtrusive it is. It looks great and does not look out of place over my black stainless steel stove. I highly recommend this hood to anyone not willing to drop $1200 on the Samsung or LG black stainless hoods.<br />I have only had this installed for three days but Broan makes very good products and this unit seem to be very durable and well made. The noise level is very reasonable for the amount of air that it moves. The light works great and I have not had any issues with it. I’m very pleased with every aspect of this hood and highly recommend it.<br />As far as price goes, Amazon and Home Depot had the best pricing but with my Prime membership I could ship this 1 day delivery for about $25.00.

B004K9MZV4,1.0,Not Happy after 4 months,"Bought this cooktop at the store. Worked great for about a month. After 3 months, the surface had a thermal crack and it won't boil water. I've had techs come out 3 times and they say they don't understand. They call in to the WP tech line and their tech states it's working correctly. My question is this, if it won't boil water, how is that working correctly? Don't buy whirlpool products. Customer service stands behind a technician they're not allowed to talk to and I've been told I'm not allowed to ask him or her questions either. Sounds like a lazy slob sitting behind a desk backing a product that they don't have to answer for. Also sounds a bit cowardly. At this point, I will say I won't be buying anything connected with whirlpool anymore.

B074DSGJXS,4.0,Good replacement part - Oven is working again!,"I checked several cross references and discovered this worked as a replacement part for my GE oven model JGSP23WEY8WW that was throwing an F2 code. For the price of this compared to the original GE part WB21X5301, I thought it was worth a try. The mounting holes were slightly off even with the one elongated hole, but was close enough that I was able to mount both screws to securely hold the sensor. This came with extra other connectors but none worked for my application. Not a big deal. I simply cut the wires and spliced them with heat shrink onto the original connector and it was good to go. make sure to re-calibrate your oven temperature setting after installing!

B002UYSHMM,5.0,I've never been more excited to do laundry,"I live in NYC, and my apartment building doesn't have laundry facilities. Until now, if I wanted to do laundry, I either had to wait until I had enough to justify a trip to the laundromat, hoard quarters, spend an afternoon there, and then lug everything back up, OR wash as much as I could in &lt;a href=""http://www.amazon.com/BRAND-NOT-SPECIFIED-Wonder-Washer/dp/B000BTDNEK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358208218&sr=8-1&keywords=wonder+washer"">this&lt;/a>, a super small capacity machine with no spin cycle, which meant lots of time spend rinsing and wringing, and waiting for still dripping clothes to eventually dry on a rack. But that's all changed now thanks to this little machine, and I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT IT!<br /><br />I received my Haier washer on January 7, and set it up January 12. It was pretty easy, taking all of about 10 minutes to get the bottom plate (which I believe is to dampen some of the sound) attached, and to swap the standard feet out for the included casters. I wheeled it over to the kitchen sink, and it only took a minute to determine how to do all the connections. I tested everything for leaks as I went along, and did notice some very slight water seepage at the connection to the washer, but nothing that a bit of Teflon tape won't fix, I'm sure, and I was able to keep it at bay by wrapping a piece of paper towel around it. My first load of laundry was a set of queen sized sheets (no pillow cases). I washed them on the medium water level (probably could've gotten away with low), and the normal cycle including wash, rinse, and spin. The machine took about as long a normal sized washer would, and I notice that it was a lot quieter than I was expecting. Even during the spin cycle, the machine really wasn't that loud - I'm on the 2nd floor, and I'm not concerned about the machine disturbing the neighbors downstairs. The spin cycle is impressive - when I took the sheets out, they were slightly damp. Definitely not dripping wet. I laid them on a wire drying rack in front of a fan, and they were bone dry in under an hour.<br /><br />I've since done about 6 or 7 loads of wash in this machine, of varying sizes and types of clothing. The machine has handled them all perfectly. It did go out of balance one time (it beeps and pauses the cycle when that happens) but it was easy to rebalance and get started again. But I'm really impressed with this machine, and I'm so, so happy I got it!",2013-01-15 00:24:05.000000000,2013,Positive,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Appliances,

B01ETRQB4I,5.0,This really sucks air.,"I originally ordered the BV 900cfm model, I understood it to have the grease catcher and highest suction, also brighter LED lighting.  When it got here i tested it and found no grease catcher. That was important to me, so I went back to Amazon.  There I found the other model that did have the grease catcher,  but lower suction (only 800 cfm)!  What to do, what to do.  Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy so I ordered this and figured I could compare them on my workbench. Yes, the first did have brighter lights and stronger fans but the second had a grease trap...testing the suction, I decided the second one sucked plenty of air and the lights were bright enough for me to see what I was cooking just fine.  The first one went back and we set out to carefully install the new hood.<br />Installation happened after installing the new stick on metal tile backsplash.  This is my new retirement home so I'm really  enjoying doing things right, at my pace.<br />  This hood is incredible.  Beautiful, and it works like a champ.  3 speed fan that catches every odor coming from my searing and pan grilling steaks. My room mate was having breathing problems from my cooking. The old exhaust fan was a typical box store variety that on its best day probably sucked 200cfm.  being willing to pay dearly to eliminate his breathing problems the box stores had nothing.  Amazon however has many choices, and many people who take the time to evaluate, so us skeptics can feel more comfortable giving away our hard earned money.<br />  Addressing some of the problems in the reviews I read:  The packaging was top notch, tight and effective, no damage to this unit during shipping.  The double fans are quite quiet, with no vibration. They have a delay shut off switch ability or immediate off. The LEDs have 2 levels. the first is like a night light in my kitchen and the high beams are plenty bright to watch what i'm sauteing.

B0070YH6WO,1.0,More noise more often,"UPDATE (11/11/14). Not even two years old, and the handle for the freezer door just snapped in half. It's out of warranty of course!<br /><br />This refrigerator makes more noise more often than any refrigerator I've ever had or that I've heard in my friends and family's homes. And not only is it noisy, but it runs more often than most refrigerators. The most annoying sound is a wheezing, like someone gasping for air, which can go on for 5 minutes or more, and starts up whenever you open the refrigerator door, as well as after periods of relative quiet. From reviews here and on Amazon, it seems that this is common to this model, but the only way to ""fix"" it is to exchange it for a more expensive model and pay the difference, and maybe a re-stocking fee (depending on where you bought it.).<br /><br />Also, there is only one shelf in the freezer compartment, but I found a shelf for $5 at a hardware store that fit below the installed shelf, and it works just fine.",2013-10-06 23:34:17.000000000,2013,Negative,GE GTH18GBDWW 18.1 Cu.

B003LIFQ5M,5.0,An Honest Review,"We purchased this washer and matching dryer after our 9-year-old washer that was already bouncing all over for a couple of years had the sensor go and over-filled spilling water all over our floor (which it had ripped the vinyl previously, so water got under and had to have the floor replaced).<br /><br />I read several reviews, but found it was just like when I wanted to purchase a new mattress.  Nothing really got an awesome review.  People either loved it or hated it, so I knew I couldn't go by reviews alone.  There was a great sale on the items when we needed them, and we talked at length to the salesman.  So glad we purchased them and didn't listen to the negative reviews!<br /><br />It may be that the people who didn't like them are used to high efficiency washers and just want more bells and whistles.  We were going from a 9-year-old machine that ruined our floor and bounced all over when it frequently became imbalanced, to this wonderful new machine.  We love that it barely uses any water compared to the old machine.  Love the different settings.  It knows what is best for different loads and I don't have to think about it.  It has a great capacity.  What would've taken me two loads can now be done in one.  Someone complained that it has longer wash cycles.  The whites are a really long cycle, but it makes sense, since they usually need more sanitizing being your sensitive articles (underwear).  I don't mind that some cycles are longer when I get the equivalent of two loads at one time.<br /><br />To me, some people are just highly critical.  I love these machines.  They do the job well and I really don't need more bells and<br />whistles. Capacity is important to me, and they do a great job with that too.  And another good thing that the salesman noted, they are made in the USA (I believe in Ohio).  So if you do have trouble, it will be a lot easier than dealing with a manufacturer whose parts are out of the country.",2012-02-07 16:12:11.000000000,2012,Positive,Whirlpool WTW7300XW 27 5 cu.

Towels especially come out hard to the touch. I still have to go to the laundromat to wash certain fabrics. It’s still a great way to save money! Just be prepared to do some ironing.<br /><br />Another downside is the length of the chord. I can’t use mine in the bathroom so I put it on the kitchen counter (and watch it while it dries so it doesn’t knock itself off!)<br /><br />You also have to measure how much to dry or else it’ll make a terrifying sound (and could possibly break).<br /><br />Still, I don’t regret the purchase.

B004XQHBHC,3.0,Good for a fridge...but there is no support from Samsung.,"As for just the fridge part, it's a decent fridge.  We've had it for about 3 years now, and not many issues to speak of.  Worst issue we've had was the freezer's defrost drain getting frozen over once.  Just emptied out the freezer, thawed out the drain, and good to go.<br /><br />Now, for the &#34;smart panel&#34;, which is the whole reason I bought this fridge.  For a while, the Google Calendar app worked perfectly.  And it was amazing, when it used to work.  A live update in the kitchen of upcoming appointments...really convenient!  Unfortunately, over the past year, the calendar app started becoming flaky, dropping its connection frequently.  I had narrowed down part of that issue to clock skew (fridge clock too far off from Google's time causing authentication failures). But now, for the past 3 months, no service at all - apparently the current issue is that Google has updated their APIs and Samsung is not going to give us any updates to get things working again.<br /><br />On the plus side, the lack of support narrows down my list of choices for new electronic toys in the future!

B08XZJDMP4,2.0,Cute. But just not great.,"I've been wanting to get a portable washer for handwashing delicates in my small apartment, and have put it off because they all look atrociously cheap. I was on the lookout for one that seemed higher quality, built to last (the ones I could find that fit that criteria were too tall for where I'd need to store it in my apartment).<br /><br />I erroneously thought the chrome on this was metal (an indicator of quality to me, because it will last longer bc it's less prone to breaking). Well, it's shiny plastic. That was disappointing. I was like, oh well, as long as it works! Certainly, someone put some thought into the looks of this—I was very attracted to the cute green and blue colors.<br /><br />Functionally, however, it is not great to use. The filling hose doesn't attach to your faucet; you have to like, hold it flush with the tap while trying to hold it steady to keep the water from spurting out everywhere. And I can't seem to find a better hose solution that is compatible with the device. I fill it up in my tub sometimes, but I have to hold it at an angle.<br /><br />The wash cycles are just fine (though some speed control would be nice). the drying/spinning function seems particularly useless given the size of the basket you have to use AND just how little you can put in there compared to how much you can wash. I always end up having to hand-wring a bunch of stuff while slowly cycling small bits of clothes in the tiny basket. And you can't overfill it—or the machine will dance off the countertop.<br /><br />Frankly, if I could return it, I would.

I love that it is quiet. I love that when the ice melts the water recycles back into the water reservoir. That way you can just use that water again to make new ice. It is perfect. The pepple  ice maker is pretty tall, so we don't have a spot for it on the counter. But if you have a wet bar or a place on the counter it would be absolutely perfect  for you and your home.

I have learned never to over fill it -- just loosely up to about 3/4 full -- and select the correct setting. I bought a nice-sized drying rack and a dolly to ease with rolling ""Maggie"" back and forth to her corner (I think it would be fairly easy without the dolly, but I'm not physically very strong and didn't want to take a chance).<br />So now I have laundry day like in olden days, roll her out, deploy the drying rack and get all my wash done in a day.

It took my husband and me just shy of an hour and a quick view of an online video. Fix was easy enough. We went ahead and replaced both parts (only one side was broken at that time). Fast forward to mid August a year later one side broke and then the other a few days later. Because the price point was inexpensive and much cheeper than a new dishwasher we re ordered this part with the thought that replacing once a year was worth it until we need to replace the whole dishwasher. Good news was that second time around took half the time because we remembered what held us up last time... linning up the metal and getting the insulation tucked under before screwing the sides back on.

B00006OAMH,2.0,"It makes ice, but . . .","I bought my WC in Nov 2004 through Amazon (best price, incredibly fast arrival) after comparison shopping with other mfrs/sellers for a week or so.  It worked as promised until last month-noisy but efficient so it sits in the basement cranking out cubes. The cubes are ""spongy"" but transferring them to a container in our refrigerator's freezer compartment door firms them up in short order.  Now the PROBLEMS: Last month, it started continually making ice regardless of whether the bin is full.  The auto-shut-off also stopped working so it tries to make ice even when the reservoir is empty (although those little ""caps"" of ice are pretty cute).  A one-star review here from June(?) '05 noted that the manufacturer was less than sympathetic.  I plan on calling them today and will follow up in another posting on whether I have the same experience.<br /><br />Regards, jhjorg WashDC",2005-10-06 14:40:25.000000000,2005,Negative,WindChaser Portable Ice Cube Maker,Amazon Home,

B002UYSHMM,4.0,"Easy to use, works, you won't be disappointed","The old washing machine in the basement was looking like it was going to break any day so I needed an intermediate washing machine until I could find a good deal on a new larger machine. After using this little thing, everyone in the house wants to do their laundry in it instead of the (still working) old machine just because it's so fun to watch and easy to set up.<br /><br />First off, if purchasing from Amazon, I believe you can rest easily about it arriving in good condition. For me, they used a lot of very thick, quality bubble wrap around the item box packed inside another shipping box.<br /><br />I did have leaking issues where the hose connects to the spout (kitchen sink) others have had. I tried removing the rubber washer(s) in various combinations as recommended, but it still leaked squirting a little water sideways no matter what I tried so I had to settle for placing a small dish towel over the faucet spout while the water is turned on to catch the spray. At first I was annoyed, but I've learned to deal with it and the rest of the machine has worked flawlessly for several months that I've forgiven it for spraying at that one point now - it's clean water anyhow, just wring the towel out at the end, and you're done. There was another minor leak when I first started around the connection point where the in-hose connects to the machine, but I bought some two dollar thread seal tape from the hardware store, and that seemed to solve the problem. It might also help the not-leaking that I don't keep the water pressure on the whole time since I turn the faucet off right after it fills to wash the first time. I wait until I hear the first spin cycle starting, then go to the sink and turn it back on to let it fill for the rinse, then turn it off again. No leaks anywhere else.<br /><br />Lint will come out the water drain hose and clog up your pipes if you don't catch it. What I do is buy some cheap knee high pantyhose from the drugstore when it's on sale and secure that over the end of the drain hose to catch the lint coming out. I just have it connected with a plastic cable tie that came with some other electronic purchase holding the cables together that I didn't use, but saved. I also use another plastic cable tie to hold the drain hose next to the in-hose at the sink so nothing moves around and water drains where I want it to.<br /><br />It cleans the cat puke out and my socks smell fresh, so the machine seems to wash alright. Some loads I've done to give an idea of size: four regular bath towels; 40x60 throw, 1 pair jeans, 2 shirts, several socks; queen size sheet, a few kitchen towels; basically just start filling the machine with water and throw clothes in to where the dry clothes reach the top of the washer bin - don't force more in than that or your clothes won't have room to slosh around and get clean.<br /><br />There is a good buffer zone from the top of where the water fills to (on high level) to the top of the washer bin, so you don't have to worry about water getting pulsed over the sides and can rest easily if you put in too much detergent and bubbles start to build up at the top (I did that) - it'll all still be contained.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase.",2011-02-15 00:29:24.000000000,2011,Positive,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Appliances,

B07H9TZ6WS,1.0,Not worth the money,"I bought this machine just over a year ago because I was looking for a small machine to wash my wife’s underwear and now my baby boy’s clothing. At first I thought this was a good machine because it has the gravity pump, but now I think it is not worth the money. Mine like others had gotten the same E1 error message just over a year after i bought the machine. It will not drain the water, so the machine stops running and you are left with a tank full of soapy, wet clothes and no way to rinse them or spin dry them. I’ve tried contacting the seller, but it was useless as they just told me since it was 2-3 weeks outside of the 1yr warranty from purchase date, they could not help me. Since then, I’ve tried replacing the water pump, checking all the electrical connections, but nothing works. I’ve wasted about six hours trying to fix this myself and the company was not helpful at all with resolving the problem. If you try to look in the product manual to see how to fix it, it literally says “Open top lid, according to before troubleshooting and settlement to settle it, then close the top lid and clear up the alarm.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I don’t expect to have to stand by a washing machine to clear an alarm every time it happens by opening and closing the lid. As they say, you get what you pay for. My opinion, don’t waste your money on this machine and spend a bit more to get a brand name that will stand by their product.",2021-01-10 15:46:52.331000090,2021,Negative,"ZENY Portable Full-Automatic Washing Machine Compact Laundry Washer Spinner Machine with Drain Pipe 10 Programs 8 Water Levels 8lbs Capacity for Apartment, RV,Camping",Appliances,

B08HQWHPHW,5.0,It worked!,"At the end of Thanksgiving Day, fortunately after all the cooking was done, when I went to warm up the pies, my oven wouldn't work! I had thought it was taking progressively longer to pre-heat and seemed to make a ""whooshing"" sound as it did so - as if it was igniting and re-igniting over and over. Thought that maybe I should look into it, but didn't do anything until it stopped working entirely. Anyway, burners worked, the fan inside the stove worked, it made a ""clicking"" noise when trying to pre-heat, so it seemed as if it wanted to start up - just no flames (or gas odor). Decided a cheap first step was to replace something that a Google search seemed to indicate was the ""igniter."" This certainly sounded like what I needed. Watched a YouTube video (so grateful that people make these, but who are they?) and decided it was within my skill set. Ordered it from Amazon, it came, I replaced it, and VOILA! it works! Woo hoo!

B00DJF6296,5.0,"Great peice of machinery, well made, but use these modifications I advise below. Happy Washing!","I am writing this review as my washer is running in the kitchen while I am watching TV and it's quiet enough that I dont even hear it while its running. If you are considering buying this product I have some advice for you. If you are going to run this off of a kitchen sink faucet you are going to want to order a Y splitter to hook to the back of the washer so the water from your sink can mix into both inputs on your washing machine. To find this product search Amazon for the following: &#34;Y Washing Machine Mixer Hose&#34;. If you are planning on running this off of a kitchen sink it will not run properly, even if you select a hot or cold only wash, the machine will still a tempt to mix hot and cold water on certain cycles and if you don't have this splitter hooked up, the machine will attempt to pump water from both input spigots. To fix this issue, install this splitter, which will hook right up to the hose that comes with your washer that has a quick disconnect on it. To make set up easy you need to remove your old faucet head and replace it with the top half of the quick disconnect. When you install it MAKE SURE you wrap all threads all the way from the hot water inputs on the washer all the way to the disconnect installed on your faucet and all threads on the splitter. If every thread does not have Teflon Tape, you WILL get a leak as you are connecting metal to plastic threads. Some of you are curious about how much clothes this machine can run and I am very impressed with the capacity for thee 1.6 CF stainless steel barrel. I am able to fill the machine up with one normal sized basket of laundry. I have done 5 towels, 4 shirts, and roughly a dozen pairs of socks and a few undergarments in one load, just make sure that your clothes don't sit higher than the three agitator jets on the side of the barrel, or they wont be cleaned and set machine to highest water level. My third piece of advice for modifying this machine is that if you are going to be storing this machine in a different place then you will be using it is to purchase a set of 4 wheels. You can get these at your local harbor freight or home depot or lowes, then line them up on the bottom of the machine, drill your pilot holes for where the wheels will be and install your bolts from the bottom and install a nut on each bolt from the interior side of the machine. I would highly recommend this unless you want to have two people pick this big boy up to carry it around as the wheels that are on here stock do not work worth a darn. Overall I am completely satisfied with this machine and I would definitely recommend it to anyone lacking washer dryer inputs or space for a larger machine. Oh,....IT IS SO NICE NOT GOING TO THE LAUNDROMAT ANYMORE!!!!! Happy washing all. If anyone has any questions about installing these modifications post a question on here I will answer it.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been running the washer heavily for one year with no problems. The washer in the above review is the model with no dryer built in. This washer has been so great to me that I am now buying the washer dryer combo model(there are several model options)  I have permanently plumbed my current washer into my water lines and drain lines under the sink just thought I'd throw that out there for anyone interested in a more permanent setup that this is possible to do...

No connections are leaking air when the dryer is on and the filters are properly installed. Vent box itself does collect lint/debris from laundry as expected. Blows out warm air, which will be nice to heat the basement in the winter, however it gets humid in the room during the summer when the dryer is on.

One of those are the spring in the doors.  I have replaced these before with much difficulty as the plastic on the door that hold the spring has worn down.  This make for the spring to not close properly or hold the small metal tube that is included with the spring.  My solution can be seen in the attached picture.  It uses part of the old spring to hold the new spring into place.  As with many people who try to replace this spring on now older machines you may have to bend or adjust the spring as well.  Other then that, the spring is a match for OEM.

B002W8C1ZK,3.0,good stove with one design-flaw,"Have owned this Bosch 300-Series Gas Range for two months. I ordered it directly from the Amazon-linked AJ Madison website. As for that store, the stove was delivered as arranged and the price was right, as it was on-sale for a few days. More on this later. Narrowed my list down to two: the Bosch and the Frigidaire FGGF3054K. The Frigidaire had a few advantages, these included a Convection oven feature, a better lower-drawer handle, a 17Kbtu front burner and a more advanced oven-rack arrangement. This Frigidaire is about $25 cheaper than the Bosch. I finally went with the Bosch because I had had good luck with their electrical components when doing repairs on my car in previous years. I also liked the heavier and more squared edges of the iron-grates covering the burners. Both stoves seem to be a good value for 8 bills. As mentioned, bought from AJ Madison. A few cautions are in order here. They will attempt to tag-on added charges after the delivery for a thing like delivering the stove up more than a certain number of steps (an arbitrary #). Before the stove is shipped, call their service rep, not sales, and tell them you will only allow delivery on condition there will be NO extra charges. I had to be a little forceful about this. And waiting for the sales department to answer the phone will require patience. These are New York-sharpies but they will be honest if you keep on top of them. I would purchase from them again, but only if the price was 25% lower than local dealers. Now some details on the Bosch stove: nice big lighted oven with a big window, fantastic non-slide full-coverage iron grating on top. The oven preheats quickly and since it is so roomy will not (my opinion) need a convection feature. All the design effort was on the burners, oven and electronics; the bottom warming/storage drawer is the typical cheapie type found on any $450 range. The working parts are fantastic, however. High-quality touchpad includes great timer functions for baking and general timing of cooking. The timers shut-off the oven as required and all timer functions beep every one-minute after timing-out, a great safety and convenience feature for me. Those not yet familiar with new gas ranges will have to get used to the electronic ignition for the top burners. Turn to lightning symbol till lit, then set to desired flame. The oven door will detent (pause) when closing but do not expect it to hold in open position solidly, as these ovens are meant to do all broiling with the door closed. On first use, you will probably notice a few things which seem like problems but are not: an error signal may pop-up on the display during first use. This immediately clears up once the stove has been plugged-in for a few minutes, clock set and the burners have been used. The other brief annoyance is that, due to the installer disturbing the gas lines, there will likely be some dust which blows up through the top burners, causing a snap sound. This clears up in a few days. Flame level adjustment is non-linear, an annoyance to some, but is compensated for by the ability to turn the flame down to an extremely low usable level.As for safety around children, the stove comes with the usual non-tip floor-bracket and has a nice electronic Lock feature for the oven door. It has the required push-to-light knobs for the 5 top burners. One caution with any of these full iron-grate stovetops is that a boy between 3-7 may get curious on seeing Mom cleaning the stove, and may lift off one of the 3 grate sections out of curiosity and drop it on his foot. Just train the little rodent. As for my 4-Star rating (see update below) of the range, I would give it a full 5 Stars but having owned the thing only a few months, I cannot comment on continued use or quality of Bosch customer service. So far, this gas range is great.<br /><br />ONE-YEAR update: Oven and top-panel electronic controls are flawless. Four of the five burners light immediately with the electronic-ignition. The left-rear burner is balky, taking ~3seconds to light. One time, a pot of spaghetti boiled over a little on this burner. The flame went out and gas was issuing from the burner. With a second burner lit heating the sauce, there could have been a big problem if built-up gas had ignited. Luckily, I was in the kitchen at the time. I suspect these electronic-ignition stoves by various brands share this problem, since burner design has to be different to allow for lighting, as opposed to the old pilot-light jobs. The second problem arose when I called customer-service to report the safety issue. The woman to whom I spoke was rude and uninterested. Moreover, she was stupid. So, considering the ~minor safety issue and the non-existent customer support, a nice 5-star range will be given only three stars by this owner. All such stoves need a heat-sensor to shut off gas flow to water-snuffed burners. Wake-up Bosch. And while you're at it, take your entire customer-service staff for a company outing at sea in stormy weather.",2009-11-19 20:45:23.000000000,2009,Neutral,"Bosch HGS3023UC300 30"" White Gas Sealed Burner Range",Amazon Home,

B001TJ5380,1.0,Not worth ruining your hardwood floors,"I don't usually write reviews of products even though I do rely on the reviews of others when purchasing an item from Amazon.  In this case, I felt responsible to let others know about this product.  It absolutely is not worth the saving since the item will leave water dripping from your Samsung refrigerator water dispenser.  And since there is no drain on the small catch basin underneath the water/ice dispenser, you will end up with a puddle of water on your floor.  If you have hardwood floors - this will cause damage.<br /><br />I do admit that I read of others having leaks and I assumed they must be installing the filters improperly or they were doing something wrong as a user, but I can confirm this product will leak even when installed properly.  I can not tell you exactly why it leaks but there is excessive pressure build up in the filter when removing and I have a feeling this added pressure is causing leakage through the dispenser shut-off valve internal to the refrigerator.<br /><br />For anyone else contemplating this purchase, I have not tried the other brands of replacement filters but I would avoid this product as the possibilities for real damage in your home is not worth the small savings.  Also, I did follow the tips I found on-line for running multiple gallons of water through the filter to remove any air pockets hoping this would stop the leaks but the filter continued to leak after multiple attempts to correct the problem.<br /><br />Buyer beware . . . .",2012-06-20 19:27:40.000000000,2012,Negative,"WaterSentinel WSS-1 Refrigerator Replacement Filter: Fits Samsung HAF-CU1 Filters (3-Pack),Blue , White",Tools & Home Improvement,$54.32

I followed the video and verified that indeed, one of the brackets was completely cracked.  I ordered the replacement via Prime, and two days later my washing machine was working again.  It is definitely easier to remove the part then put it back in, but it still only took me about 30 minutes to carefully put it back together.<br /><br />One note on putting it back together: I apparently didn't tighten something somewhere correctly, and the machine was jerking violently when it stopped spinning.  I removed the casing and double checked all of my work, and it worked perfectly after I did so.<br /><br />My washing machine is old and will need to be replaced at some point I am sure-- but I like that this very affordable part can keep it running for who knows how much longer (knock on wood).",2015-03-23 20:47:01.000000000,2015,Positive,285852AR for Whirlpool Kenmore Heavy Duty Washer Coupling,Tools & Home Improvement,$10.18

B002UYSHMM,5.0,Everything I needed and expected for the price!!!,"I bought this little washer over two months of tedious internet research.  I needed a washing machine for my small two bedroom apartment and to do my sons' laundry and my own.  There are many portable washing machines out there that are larger or smaller with varying functions and prices, however this machine seemed to fit my needs the best and it was the cheapest!.  I just needed a small machine that would wash a reasonable amount of clothes with little to no hassle.  I had read some of the other feedback about the machines noisyness, leakness, and hasslesome bottom plate, and extremely small basket and here is what I found....<br /><br />I ordered the machine and had it within 7 days, I found that reasonable as i did not pay for shipping, it was also delivered with no damage to the machine or the box, I had it shipped fedex so i was able to track it daily.<br /><br />The machine was very easy to put together out of the box, all I required was a phillips head screw driver.  The bottom plate was hasslesome to install but I got it on, after that the rest was cake, I had it up and running within 22 minutes total.<br /><br />I did a quick wash cycle and the machine ran smooth and strong, adding and draining water as nessacary.  I didn't find the machine to be any noisier than any other washing appliance, the machine did rattle slightly durring the spin cycle but I have an area rug underneath it so it was neither noisy or disturbing to me.  I experienced no leaks durring this cycle.<br /><br />the clothes came out clean and wrung out, I was actually very impressed.<br /><br />The basket size is actually larger than it may seem, I was able to fit into the machine about 3/4 of a standard wash!!!!!<br /><br />All in all for the price and expectation I gave this machine 5 stars because it does what it say it will do, I have not experienced any hassles with it as of yet and actually I am  more than pleased with the machine.  I now look forward to never going to the laundry mat again or piled up laundry.  I can see in the future having to go to the laundry mat once a month or two months for haevy blankets and rugs but all in all this little machine has handled my washes fine, to include sheets, light weight blankets, and jeans!!!  Just distribute the loads carefully, remember one light weight blanket may mean one wash!!!<br /><br />I am very pleased with this machine!!!! If you would like to see some pictures of it hooked up to the sink so you can get some perspective on it check out my face book page...jaime billiel in charlestown nh...............<br /><br />UPDATE 2015<br /><br />Hello all as of my last review I may have told you that I moved and gave my machine to my sister whom till this day FIVE YEARS LATER is still using the little machine :)...... Since then I moved to an apt and purchased a full size set, I met a man and we moved in together to a place with no hook ups so geuss what..... I PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND USED It for TWO MORE YEARS!!!!!!!  Then I bought my very OWN HOUSE with a full size pair (still with my man).  And I still HAVE that little machine!  LOL<br /><br />I have an elderly woman who wants to buy it but I dont know if she will follow through or not.<br /><br />The point of my update, two machines, five years, no problems, still going strong.  I may just keep the mini machine if the lady doesnt come to get it for back up, or sell it in a yard sale!!!!!!!!",2010-06-23 23:20:06.000000000,2010,Positive,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Appliances,

I’d rather wash these in the sink from an effort standpoint.<br /><br />This might work if your clothes aren’t very dirty but even then the water that you’d waste is hard to justify.<br /><br />Update: the company's customer service reached out to me and were very helpful.

B001PVYW48,5.0,best Keurig rack option available,"My husband and I agree this K Cup rack is one of the best purchases we've made for our home - along with the Keurig itself.

It's also very easy to clean.  The brushed-look silver parts are plastic but don't look too cheap next to stainless steel.  Ours is kept in a busy area of the kitchen and it's frequently splashed with coffee, grease, pancake batter, and the like, but everything just wipes right off.  I have several friends and family members who also own Keurig coffee makers and they have various OTHER types of holders and racks for their K cups.  They have ALL commented to me that they really like ours better and wish they had waited before going for the popular circular chrome carousel or the drawer-style one.

B00C8CWOGG,1.0,Great if you like wet clothes,"I've had many different driers over the years, and they've all dried clothes. The only differences were capacity, heat source, and features. It didn't matter the capacity, the heat source (gas or electric), or the features, they all had one thing in common, they dried your clothes. The permanent press cycles are nice, the cool down cycles are nice, infinite temperature settings are nice, but they are all worthless if it doesn't ultimately dry your clothes in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Then there's this drier. It is the absolute worst drier I have ever used. It will not dry a load of clothes on one dry cycle. Doesn't matter how many clothes are in the drier, how long the cycle is, the temperature of the cycle, items never come out dry. And I don't mean a little dampness or slight cool-to-the-touch around the waist line, I mean wet.  It always takes at least 2 cycles, and often more, to get them dry. Especially towels.  I will be up half the night restarting the drier every 75 minutes or so just to get one load dry!  It must have 15 different drying cycle types, and it doesn't matter which one you use, everything is still is wet on completion.<br /><br />This is the only computerized drier I've ever purchased, and it will be the last.

We couldn’t ever figure how water was leaking, but it was suggested that we simply replace the ice maker itself.  Easy replacement; watch a YouTube video or two before you start since you’re working in a confined area and it will help guide you on where to look for the screws. You will need to cannibalize the wiring harness, the plastic bottom piece/shelf thing (it will be obvious when you remove the old one) and the on/off arm. Given the price of this item, I think it’s a bit cheap these parts are not included, but they were easy to detach and add onto the replacement (I recall someone said they had to cannibalize the heater coil, too, but that was included on my new part).",2019-09-28 14:02:33.411999941,2019,Positive,Whirlpool W10300022 WPW10300022 Icemaker,Tools & Home Improvement,$142.17

B00BUYJBWS,5.0,"A little more work, but you get your favorite coffee and it's WAY more economical than purchasing the Kcups","It was pointed out to me that purchasing the KCups that are prefilled is like spending $60 a pound on coffee that is already stale by the time you brew it!  Whether it is actually $60/lb I don't know, but you are playing a premium for the convenience of coffee that is not as fresh as if you put your own freshly-ground coffee in.<br /><br />So I purchased some coffee I like from a local roastery and have been using it.  The coffee tastes WAY better than the prefilled KCups you buy - regardless of the brand, and I've tried them all.  If you think about it, the tiny bit of coffee, already ground, has been sitting in these KCups for how long? and they aren't vacuum packed or anything, and there is usually a 1/4 inch of airspace in them as well which doesn't bode well for the coffee in terms of freshness.<br /><br />You do have to clean the filter after each use, but it's really easy and you can compost the grounds.<br /><br />In addition, if you drink one cup of coffee each day, you are saving our planet from 365 KCups per year!!",2014-03-21 20:35:08.000000000,2014,Positive,PureWater Filters My Cup Replacement Coffee Filter Capsule Set with mesh basket for Single Serve Brewer Models B30 B31 B40 B50 B60 B70,Amazon Home,$6.49

For seven years I have lived in a apartment with two children and got tired of the neighbors hogging the machines as their are only two in the whole building. So then we started going to the laundry mat. I have had it and was so tired of waking up early to be at the laundry mat before the rush so I started doing my research. I went back and forth and I decided on this one. There are plenty cheaper ones but the best thing about this one is the automatic drain pump !! This thing drained in less than a minute! Compared to gravity drains and that could take some time depending. As for the washing I was not disappointed with how agitated it got the clothes! Right off the bat I could see the dirty water!! I was actually able to fit quite a lot of my laundry in here with out over loading it and couldn't be happier! The spin cycle is just as amazing and when you finally have a washing machine after not having the luxury, having to load them in the spinner is no issue or hassle at all! I would say it got 90% of the water out and I am trying something new by hang drying them and after only a half hour they are almost dry. Define after two hours the heavier items will be dry. Again if you have been needing a washing machine and are tired of having to leave your home to wash stop guessing and wondering and purchase this machine you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!",2017-08-18 02:48:11.828999996,2017,Positive,"Ivation Small Compact Portable Washing Machine – Twin Tub Washer & Spin with 12.12 Lb.

B000BTDNEK,4.0,"Excellent, For What It Is","I've always been very skeptical of anything bearing the ""As Seen On TV"" label, as the Wonder Washer did at one time.  But when I moved into an apartment and started plunking down $1.50 for each load of clothes in a small coin-operated machine, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />After a few tries I found that the Wonder Washer isn't up to handling jeans or sheets (the latter won't fit).  Parts of it are a bit lightly constructed and I would be cautious about overloading it or expecting the plastic bucket and lid to put up with rough handling (to my knowledge, replacements are not available).  I finally settled on using my machine strictly for bleach loads--a tablespoon of bleach does the job and as a one-person household, I average a ""white load"" a bit more often than once a week.  In less than a year, the Wonder Washer has more than paid for itself in bleach and detergent savings along with avoided coin-op loads.<br /><br />The only gripe I have with the Wonder Washer is that it has no spin cycle and does not drain itself so the bucket must be removed, emptied, and refilled for a rinse cycle (I've found that I get the best rinse if I fill and empty the bucket once before refilling it and putting it back on the base).  Clothes come out of the machine saturated and must be squeezed out even before machine drying or, as I generally do, hanging on the shower rod (when the humidity is low, they'll dry overnight--when it's higher, they won't).<br /><br />So....using the Wonder Washer is more of a hands-on process than using a fully-automatic machine.  But you can't beat the price, and if you can accept its limitations, it will serve you well.",2011-06-04 02:52:14.000000000,2011,Positive,As Seen On TV 347034-BC00380150 Partable Wonder Washer,Appliances,$69.99

A less powerful motor may fail sooner.<br /><br />Original: Teflon coated.<br />This product: Appears to be painted.<br /><br />Original: Fins (heat sink)which helps it make ice faster.<br />This product: No fins, which does make it lighter and a little smaller<br /><br />The original unit has a slightly larger heating element than this product.<br /><br />It appears that all the parts are interchangeable.

B004A8E8ME,4.0,A great addition to any kitchen,"I ordered the NuWave mini when I ordered my NuWave Pro since it was free and only paid $30 shipping through the manufacturer site. Initially, I was thinking it would be a good gift for someone since I now have the Pro....but....I'm liking the Mini more when it's just me at home cooking a quick dinner.<br /><br />First, I find the $90+ price to be way over the top. I'd find $39-$49 acceptable. Price isn't an indicator of quality, but an indicator of what you can/can't use it for. Funny enough you can buy the parts separately for ~$70.<br /><br />Secondly, make sure you keep the recommended cooking chart handy. I'm finding on average to add ~2 minutes per side to the cooking instructions. My first  frozen boneless skinless chicken thigh came out still pinkish in the middle. Adding 2 minutes more per side did the trick the next night.  The chicken was moist, done, and tasty.<br /><br />The electronic keypad seems durable and the timer is loud enough to be heard in another room. Good thing is, when the timer alerts, the NuWave turns off. No danger of overcooking this way.<br /><br />The dome seems to be sturdy enough, but I'm hoping if my dome cracks, it does so while in the first year.  If not, it's a measely $12 to replace.<br /><br />The rack can be flipped to get food closer to the heating element or further away by a margin of about an inch.  Not much difference.<br /><br />The Mini is is ideal for 1-2 people. I can fit two chicken pieces or two medium steaks, or two fish fillets. On the cooking videos, Chef Jennifer fills in around the meat with veggies. I would eat more veggies than can fit on the rack with 2 pieces of meat. Thus, why it's a mini.  But it cooks them well with a little adjustment on cooking times. I always start frozen and it cooks very well.<br /><br />The variety of foods you can cook in the Mini is only limited by the size of the food. If it's just me cooking for me, I can fit a piece of meat and veggies in and have dinner in about 15 to 20 minutes. Cleanup for the NuWave mini is SO EASY. While it's dishwasher safe (top rack for dome), I'll only hand wash it in the hopes of the dome lasting longer. It's easy enough so why not?<br /><br />Due to the Mini size, there aren't any official accessories to add to the NuWave mini but it does what it's designed to do very well. I think if the price dropped below $50 for this model, they would sell like hotcakes.<br /><br />A final plus to the NuWave brand is their excellent website where you can find replacement parts for this model. With your purchase, you also get free access to the NuWave cooking club that has recipes, videos, and tips for how to use your NuWave. For a budding ManChef, this really helps give me ideas.<br /><br />Enjoy! I have. :)",2012-11-29 06:43:06.000000000,2012,Positive,"NuWave 20102 Oven, Mini",Amazon Home,

B0027DW4QG,5.0,They work as designed and described.,"It is much easier to clean around than the old rubber gasket type that I was using before.

B01N56KEU6,4.0,Confusion between model numbers led to me order the thing I didn't want.,"Update: Bumped the stars to 4. This is a nice product. I have been using the temp controller for a couple of days now, with my chick brooder heat lamp. Working great. I would only knock 1/2 a star off for the model # thing, but, of course, not an option. Happy with the item overall. Just wish it had the wifi I had originally been after.<br /><br />Knocked off stars for the ambiguous model numbers. Will update stars accordingly, or not, based on actual usage once I have used it.<br /><br />I bought this to use the temp controller with a brooder heat lamp, and an EcoGlow brooder, and was trying to get the model with wifi so I could monitor and adjust when away from home. I have a thing about not wanting to burn my house down.<br /><br />The single wifi unit, with the SAME model number, would have take a MONTH  to be delivered to me. Needed it ASAP. So I ordered this one, with the SAME model number, mistakenly thinking they were the same. Didn't really need the humidity monitor, but having the temp controller a full month earlier was a big deal. Alas, I could have had the non-wifi temp controller alone for $35, instead of $70, in the same couple of days time.<br /><br />I'll blame myself for not catching that there is no mention of wifi capability in this item description. Both units having the ITC-308 model number is confusing.<br /><br />So make sure you are getting what you think you are. It was a super easy mistake to make.<br /><br />As for the meters themselves, I have just begun unboxing and will be setting it up for my chicks in the next day or two. Initial impression is that they appear to be well-made controllers and good quality. Not quite what I wanted for my chicks, but they will be living outdoors before I could get a wifi version in hand. So I will live with it. I have no doubt it will be fine for use with seed mats and the like, so it will see considerable usage one way or another.",2019-05-02 06:06:01.423000097,2019,Positive,Inkbird ITC-308 Temperature Controller with IHC-200 Humidity Controller,Amazon Home,$72.99

B08TBYPK4J,5.0,Very similar performance to a paper filter,"I got this because I wanted to use my Aeropress to strain loose tea that had been brewed and didn't want to waste more paper filters. It works great for that. I use the one with larger holes (you can look through the filters side by side at a light and see which has the bigger holes, but otherwise it is hard to tell them apart) for tea. Since the tea was brewed already, I didn't care how quickly it would drain, but it was still pretty slow and needed to use the plunger to get the tea through in a reasonable amount of time, with about the same resistance I was used to with paper filters. To see how it did with coffee, I tried that too and it is great, again almost the same as paper filters. Using the smaller holes for coffee, it is no problem pouring the water in and then setting the plunger and letting it steep (without doing inverted). Very easy to clean when you are cleaning the Aeropress anyway. The filters are non-magnetic, so probably actual stainless steel. For what these are, two perforated metal disks, it is a little expensive, but they work very well.",2022-04-26 18:22:33.634999990,2022,Positive,2 Pieces Disc Metal Coffee Filters Fine and Ultra-fine Makers Reusable Metal Coffee Filters Quality Coated Stainless Steel in Coffee Maker,Amazon Home,$5.99

B07TM3CTH6,1.0,Enjoy spending half a day tearing your drier apart every 6 months or so? definitely buy this kit!,"when it was about 12 years old our samsung drier started making horrible, terrifying screeching noises. At first I thought maybe it was just hitting puberty and its voice changing, but after consulting the great DIY repair oracle (youtube), I figured it must be one of the components included in this kit, and bought it, foolishly ignoring the negative reviews.<br /><br />when I got the drier taken apart (no small feat in my 6x9 laundry room where it's stacked on top the washer and surrounded by an immobile shelving unit), it was apparent that only the front rollers were shot, so i just replaced those with the ones that came in this kit. And concluded my saturday afternoon putting everything back together while experimenting with some new expletives.<br /><br />fast forward 6 months and the screeching started again. ""It must be the rear ones this time!"" I told myself, sure that there was NO WAY the 6 month old front rollers could be shot already.<br /><br />after another expletive-filled disassembly process, I was quite dismayed to find that indeed, it was the 6-month old rollers that were shot. the others (OEM) were still perfect, and the drum belt was fine.<br /><br />In the photos, the 6-month old parts are at the top, and the new ones at the bottom. As you can see, the bearings in these rollers literally just disintegrated--in 6 months! there were no bearings and no discernable metal pieces from the roller's axis. the axle itself was ok but the rest of the assembly literally turned to dust (which, btw, was all over the inside of the drier housing). Impressive!<br /><br />I had bought another similarly-priced set to replace them, and didn't have the heart to put the whole thing on hold to order a set of OEM parts, so I used those.

First, their size won’t cover the whole stove so you’ll have to cut a few strips to put in between a cover and the other, which will inevitably move around and get messy. Second, the material is somewhat stiff and won’t adhere to the stove, so as it lifts it will touch the burner causing it to burn weird. Third, as the gas burns directly on it (since, as stated before, it won’t adhere to the stove) the edge of the covers will actually burn and release a white dust which will mess up your whole stove underneath (the whole point I bought these was to keep the stove clean). I spent an hour cutting and positioning these covers and cooked one meal, only to end up throwing them away after the first use. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy them.

Too bad, so sad, you'll just have to fork up another $900.00 for another unit, sucker.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that you cannot get Danby wine or beverage coolers serviced, states Danby customer service, as they are ""contained units"" which means the entire unit has to be replaced under warranty, not just the cooling elements. If it breaks during the first year, they will OSTENSIBLY send you a new unit. But who knows if they will even honor their one year warranty, based upon their reluctance to handle the simplest of customer service issues with us. It took days to get to a representative and even then they completely refused to stand behind their product.<br /><br />After several tries with Danby customer service to no avail, we contacted the President of Danby, whom we were sure would make this situation right but were completely ignored. I'll bet he gets a lot of calls and mail about this very thing. Do yourself a favor and save on shipping - put $900 IN A PILE AND BURN IT rather than buy any Danby product. Better yet, buy another brand, as we did. Our new cooler works just fine and it can be repaired if it breaks, as it is 21st century technology. Our new unit was cheaper, too, and is better looking.<br /><br />Come on! It's a little fridge, not rocket science, and they can't get a $900 wine cooler to work for more than four months without breaking down? I'd be interested to hear from any other Danby wine cooler purchasers as I have a suspicion that these units are manufactured to meet planned obsolescence of approximately one year as a means of bilking the consumer.<br /><br />Yes, you heard me, Danby, if you read these reviews: Your customer service reps were too practiced in their denial of warranty coverage for us to believe that this is an uncommon occurrence. We'd also like to hear from you, Danby, since we've not received a reply to any of our communications for several months now.<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR!",2010-04-19 15:13:12.000000000,2010,Negative,Danby DWC1534BLS 3.7 Cu.

A good one is worth every penny!,"I have to start by saying that we bought this because it matches the refrigerator and ended up getting the mid-level slate washer because the handle matches our fridge and for a couple hundred more you get the stainless steel case.<br /><br />We have only had it for a few weeks now, but boy do our dishes look so much clearer and cleaner.  I read some reviews that mentioned that it was difficult to hook up, but it was the same as any dishwasher I have ever installed.  The only thing we needed was a hose adapter 90 degree elbow to install it and some wire nuts.  You can buy a dishwasher install kit at Lowes or any other home improvement store that will include what you need.<br /><br />The only thing that surprised me is how long the cycle takes.  Almost a couple hours for the regular cycle.  However, we run it at night and don't do more than one load per day so, no worries.  In the past, I have bought a few cheap dishwashers and I am very happy that I didn't do it again.  Think about it, this thing affects every meal and drink you have at your house.  Spend some money on a good one so you don't waste your time and money washing dishes twice, or getting sick from the residue the washer leaves behind.<br /><br />Not only does it clean the dishes very well, but the door springs work well, it makes almost no noise when running and the silverware basket comes out and goes back in easily which is nice.  My old dishwashers made it difficult for whatever reason.<br /><br />We are now only using the 3 in one cascade packets and it is much easier and again, the dishes look amazing.  Even my 8 year old daughter mentioned how much cleaner our cups look after just two times through the wash.  I definitely recommend this washer, it has been wonderful so far.

And that was the only 2 they sent.<br /><br />I thought it could have been a shipping mistake, things happen.  Amazon doesn't have a complaint item for ""too few items shipped"".  So I simply returned it, hoping that it was simply a one time mistake.<br /><br />I was wrong.  I sent back the first two and the sent me a new package.  Only 2 again the second shipment.

B005R597HA,5.0,good and solid dryer,"I purchased this dryer from abc warehouse, not amizon because of cost for shipping, but its the same dryer anyway. so I am going to cover 3 things about this dryer, First is size, second is venting and filters, and last, is it worth the money.<br /><br />First, size. this dryer is close to 1/4 size of a regular dryer, and this means it is great for a small apartment like mine. the dryer is short and the controls are at the bottom of the dryer so to save my back I bought a wire 5 tier shelf and used 1/2 of it with a shelf on the bottom and one close to the top. bottom for clothes basket and detergent storage, and top for the dryer, being 40 lbs and heavier with wet clothes I chose a shelf with 80+ lbs per shelf. I used the adjustable feet of the dryer to screw in from under the shelf to hold it securely. Now the controls are within reach and the dryer is more accessible.<br /><br />second, venting and filters. I attached the plastic vent to the back of the dryer and face this up toward the ceiling. after about 2 months of use, be sure to clean around the dryer. Dust and lint will accumulate. there is a noticeable amount of moisture in the air when in use but it only lasts from a few min after the dryer starts until about 20 min before the dryer stops. I have noticed no reason to vent this dryer outside, except for maybe in the hotter seasons where drying clothes conflicts with the efficiency of air-conditioners. For the filters they are basically felt. so after 7 to 8 months with the original filter material I bought a felt piece at the arts and crafts isle at walmart and one sheet made both the front and rear filters. On cleaning the filters, use a lint roller to remove the lint build up after about every second or third use.<br /><br />last, is it worth the money, Yes. for drying clothes I load the dryer no more than 2/3 full and it takes 200 min (dial straight down) for a full load. for jeans and on hot days where I don't want to run a heat source and the air conditioning, I bought a wood hanging rack and I hang the clothes and jeans on these with a fan on them, making sure to flip the clothes after a few hours. Then after the clothes are dry, I run the dryer with no heat for 20 min to ""soften"" up the clothes and remove wrinkles. I have noticed very little in the cost of electricity for this dryer, about $7 to $10 a month. And that is the same cost as going to a laundry-mat.<br /><br />This ends my review. No noises no problems, just a little maintenance and care.",2013-07-04 16:23:34.000000000,2013,Positive,Avanti 110-Volt Automatic Portable Compact Dryer with Stainless Drum and See-Thru Window,Amazon Home,

After reading all the reviews this dishwasher sounded the best.<br /><br />It’s was so easy to install-just place on countertop-plug into electric outlet-pour water in top hole (or you can do the hose water hook up)-then push start. Yeah that easy!<br /><br />And it cleans like anything. It has upper and lower spray arms that spray the heck out of everything. I use the express wash cuz the normal wash was way to much. It even has a dry cycle! But beware, unless you have small pots/pans, it’s doubtful those will fit inside washer, my 10’ fry pan does not. But you can fit 4 place settings=dishes, bowls, cups, glasses & cutlery in it with no problem. An added bonus is the blue light it emits when starting & stopping is kind of cool!<br /><br />I wholly recommend this dishwasher and very very happy & pleased with it.",2021-08-16 01:48:44.365000010,2021,Positive,"Countertop Portable Dishwasher, NOVETE Compact Dishwasher with 5-Liter Built-in Water Tank, 5 Washing Programs with Baby Care, Fruit Washing, Hot Air-dry Storage",Appliances,

B07CT9W4JC,5.0,Fixed GE GSS25QGTGWW Cooling & Water Dispenser!,"I used this evaporator fan motor to fix my GE refrigerator model GSS25QGTGWW.<br /><br />The original fan completely failed after more than 10 years of use.<br /><br />Replacing the fan fixed the cooling problem that developed over a weak ago and also fixed my water dispenser! For years I had problems with my water dispenser freezing up. This solved both issues. Apparently my previous fan was having issues for several years, but was still running, so I didn't know it needed replacement.<br /><br />An early symptom of an evaporator fan that is not performing well is a frozen water dispenser line. This is especially the case with the GE refrigerator model GSS25QGTGWW.<br /><br />A symptom of an evaporator fan that has completely died is that the refrigerator will be very icy near the bottom on both the refrigerator side and the freezer side, and not cold enough on the top of both sides.<br /><br />A simple test to confirm the issue is caused by the fan not running at all is to leave the freezer open for 3 minutes. At that point GE says the fan should always turn on, and mine did not. This could also indicate a problem with the main controller board's fan control circuit, but that's rare, and for me that was not the case, fortunately, because the main controller board costs a lot more to replace.<br /><br />The repair was easy but time consuming. There were a lot of parts to remove to get to the evaporator fan motor.<br /><br />The new fan is VERY QUIET compared to the original and seems to be functioning better overall than the original did before it died. Prior to my original fan dying, it was very noisy for many years.<br /><br />So far things are working great.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money.

B00IQAC0C2,5.0,Love this refrigerator!,"We purchased this refrigerator in June of 1014.  I debated between this model and the model that had four doors, but eventually got this one because it had more room inside. In retrospect, I might have done better with purchasing the four door model because in order to access the large pull out drawer it is necessary to open both the doors, which, in my mind, wastes electricity. But that is a choice I made that in no way affects the performance of the refrigerator.  We have not had any issues yet with the refrigerator and overall I am very pleased with it.  Yes, it will at times make noise, but to me that's not an annoyance.  It produces a lot of ice and is able to keep up with the needs of my large family, which is a big plus. I love all of the room inside the refrigerator and freezer and it is very easy to organize everything in all the compartments.  My 7-year-old grandson is able to access the freezer easily to get popsicles, which saves me time. He is also able to access everything in the refrigerator as we have put the items he likes down toward the bottom. The outside is easy to keep clean--I use furniture polish to clean it and it works like a charm. If something gets spilled, it only spills on the shelf and clean up is pretty easy.  The drawers open easily and seem to be pretty sturdy. I replaced a refrigerator that fell to pieces (drawers fell off tracks, pieces of plastic on shelves broke off, water and ice dispenser buttons broke off, etc,) with this one, and thus far is has held up quite well with my very rough family. Overall, I love this refrigerator and have no complaints whatsoever.",2015-03-08 19:41:25.000000000,2015,Positive,"Samsung RF28HFEDBSR Energy Star 28 Cu. Ft.

B000W3P4AQ,4.0,Awesome dual-fuel range!  Some things to consider.,"I went back and forth before finally deciding to purchase this range.  I received a 10% discount off list, which means I paid North of $2,600.  That is a LOT of money in my world.<br /><br />  Imagine my surprise, when the range was delivered and I discovered that it required a 220V outlet!  Now this oversight was 100% my fault.  I just want to prevent others from learning this the hard way (like I did).  Furthermore, this GE Cafe dual-fuel range requires a 40 amp circuit!  My electric dryer requires only 20 amps!<br /><br />So $415 later (the cost of running a 50 amp circuit) I could cook!<br /><br />Cooktop:  You will want to buy ""Simple Green"" (degreaser) & a bunch of the fiber non-metalic scrubbers.  Simple Green's instructions say that it can be used straight or diluted 1:10 with water.  You'll want to use it full strength.  This range has the most infuriating of all types of  stainless steel - trust me.  This range will work your butt off to get/keep clean.  This range is such a pain to clean - it will change the way you cook.  You will turn things down - so they don't spit.  You will use lids - when you never used to use lids.  On the positive side, I really like the oblong burner in the middle & the high output front right burner.<br /><br />Griddle:  Very good.  The griddle grate is super dense & large.  Grease flows away from your foods into a well designed catch.  In fact, the tendency for grease to move away from foods and into the grease catch can be frustrating when trying to cook breakfast ""Waffle House"" style.  However, I'll take on a George Foreman grill any day!<br /><br />Oven:  Superlative!  The touch screen controls are elegant & intuitive!  The oven has a digital temperature readout that tells you the temperature and shows you the elements in use via a picture!  Very cool.  The (2) oven lights & the crystal clear dual-pane window allow you to see everything that's going on.  Anything you bake, convection bake, convection roast - will exceed your expectations!<br /><br />That's it.  It was a rocky road ($$$) to get here, but I love my GE Cafe.",2009-01-19 20:26:29.000000000,2009,Positive,GE Cafe : C2S980SEMSS 30 Free Standing Dual-Fuel Range w/5 Sealed Burners,Amazon Home,

B07QK8SQRH,5.0,really happy with our car fridge,"This is my initial review before I take it on a 5 day trip with it running for long periods of time.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It’s very sturdy, very quiet, and cools the compartment quickly. I also like the lifetime warranty, made it easier to buy knowing if something goes wrong hopefully they follow through If anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The manual is terrible, and I had to figure everything out. Fortunately it’s pretty simple device. You plug it in and turn it on and it cools up and down with 2 buttons in Celsius degrees. The settings for efficiency don't match the manual. It’s 1 2 or 3 where the manual says high medium low in regards to cooling speed I’m assuming. I’ll probably leave it on eco mode most of the time.<br />The app to control it is not available in the United States.<br /><br />If it stays in one piece and continues to work like it does I’ll be very happy to give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Update:<br />It did really well on our trip. Kept everything cold during our 12 hour drive.

B0039V7JFG,3.0,Overal does wash & dry but involves a lot of maintenance and has a lot of issues for the price.,"So I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this and will now contribute based on my experience so far.<br /><br />I did not purchase this new from Amazon but used off of Craigslist (about 1/2 the price) - supposedly it was bought in June of this year so it is only about 6 months old and still under warranty. The owner was selling it because he is a landlord who bought it for his tenant and the tenant did not like how long the cycles took.<br /><br />I bought it because we have an old house and very little room - it was kind of a compromise between myself and my partner as a better option might have been for us to purchase separate compact washer & dryer but he wanted a larger capacity.<br /><br />This machine is large - going from a compact portable washer to this was a big difference - make sure you have measured your space before purchasing. The combo will help us preserve vertical space but it did not help at all in floor/hall space.<br /><br />So here is what I have found so far...<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* does essentially what it is supposed to do - washes with very little water and definitely dries (I have not tried to overload this and have probably only filled it between 1/3 to 2/3's so far but clothes have come out more than enough dry (on ""normal"" setting).<br /><br />* feels fancy and fun with the lights & noise<br /><br />* takes up half the space of two full-size machines<br /><br />* a good amount of options for different kinds of clothes - although initially seems kind of complicated it's pretty straightforward to set up - and because it's front load will be pretty gentle on your clothes<br /><br />* clothes come out dry when they're done ( no need to be there to change them from washer to dryer )<br /><br />* being able to set it on timer is nice - I am not comfortable letting this  be on while not at home yet but it's nice to set it to go off an hour or two before I wake up<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />* this is a very expensive machine and for the cost I would expect it to work MUCH better out of the box than it does - it will require regular cleaning & maintenance to keep it in top working order - much more than a regular dryer would (I will go into details below)<br /><br />* it is difficult to level; or I should say - I have leveled it pretty well based on my level but it still started shimmying away when I had a larger load in - we do have the challenge of very out of whack old house floors but this machine seems to have issues when it comes to getting it leveled correctly. I found a good post here on how to deal with this (and it's on my to-do list): [...]<br /><br />* I was pleasantly surprised that the first load I put in estimated less than 2 hours time (it was not a large load but based on what I'd read I was expecting worse) - however (and I have read this an issue for others) - when it got down to 6 min left on the display it stopped at 6 min for about 15-20 min before finishing and moving on; I looked this up and found others having this issue - I am not sure if it's a maintenance issue of the dryer not working well enough or a sensor issue - some LG dryer reviews said you need to wipe the sensors off but on this machine I am not sure where this is; so far what I have done to try and alleviate this issue is 1) make sure to wipe the lint out of the door seal real well (not easy - more below on this); 2) do the drain pump maintenance (pretty easy); and just to make sure I have all my bases covered I am going to go ahead and take the machine apart to clean out where the lint supposedly gets stuck - since I haven't been the original owner - I'd like to see where it's at now before I have to do it again<br /><br />* lint lint and more lint: you have probably already read this is an issue. it very much is an issue. you will need to wipe the rubber door seal after each use and it is not an easy simple & quick thing to do as the seal has a deep fold in it that is not easy to get your fingers into and also lint will get stuck under the edge of the seal so you kind of have to go around and pull this up. plan on this taking a good 5 min and not being a fun task - this is an issue that really makes me have to give the machine a lower review - LG REALLY SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO TAKE CARE OF THE LINT collection because there is essentially none and, as you have probably read, it leads to a larger issue of the dryer eventually not working and requiring you to take apart the machine in order to clean it out (unless you want to hire someone) but a great instructions on how to do this are here: [...]<br /><br />* the door rattle on high spin cycle - this is another big deal breaker for me in regards to giving this a good review. I have read it as being an issue with other people too - as far as i'm concerned there's no excuse for this - it is loud and annoying. I may be able to get it to be less of an issue if I can get the machine better leveled - and I have also heard of people making their own dampener by stuffing some cardboard in between the door and machine - either way - not cool LG. basically there is not proper padding between the door and it has wiggle room (when shut you can kind of push on it yourself and hear how it will sound if it happened multiple times).<br /><br />* another note on noise: as others have wrote - the pump is noisy. nothing to say except that yes, it is, and it will go on and off throughout the whole cycle; think of it as a loud humidifier or old loud fridge motor noise; when the pump is not going off it's very quiet; our bedroom is upstairs and the noise will not be loud enough to wake us up - and if you have well insulated walls it may not be an issue for you either - but don't go into it  thinking that this thing is going to be quiet if you have thin walls or floors<br /><br />* smell: it smells a bit moldy/musty; I am just running Tub Clean for the first time today - will update later to let you know if the smell is alleviated - I am going to assume that the previous owner may not have done this at all.<br /><br />* other random issues which I can live with: the instructions say to hold the spinsense button down for 3 seconds to activate - this is not working for me ( I read somewhere that it won't work if you have the dryer set to cycle on - I will try again and see if that solves it ); when I went to use the Spin/Dry cycle the timer showed it as going to take 5+ hours even though I put in a very small load and there was no way it should have taken that long - for some reason the machine didn't run it's own sensor but just automatically goes to 5 hours - you can solve this by choosing the timed dry instead ""normal"" or ""more""<br /><br />Overall I would NOT recommend purchasing this machine at full price. There are too many maintenance and glitchy issues to spend this kind of money. But, if you can find it on sale or used - it might be what you need to deal with space issues. Just make sure you understand that you will have to spend time to maintain it correctly and yes, the overall cycle times on a full load are going to be much longer than they would be on a normal washer/dryer. There is a big learning curve on the tiny things you run into that won't really be covered in the manual and for which you'll have to consult other reviews, internet search, etc to solve on your own. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind doing this  - then this machine may work out for you. But if you're looking for a low-maintenance machine that you won't need to worry about - this isn't it.",2013-12-15 16:56:55.000000000,2013,Neutral,LG 3.6 CF FRONT LOAD WASHER DRYER COMBO,Appliances,

So after finding I could not get a replacement rubber door seal, I looked around and found these and ordered this item, using two of the right-angle pieces for two opposing of the four corners, and just making a 45-degree cut and sticking it all on with 3M 5200 marine adhesive/sealer.

Just do not overload, or put in too many items that are known to be water absorbent (like towels) and you will not regret your purchase.

B003ZVT3PO,5.0,Best Machine for the Money,"Although I am not surprised that there are not reviews for this washing machine here, since it should be purchased from a local retailer who should install it, but I am really surprised that there are no reviews at all.<br />I replaced a 17 year old Maytag top loader with this machine and am not looking back.  The old Maytag was still running, although was leaking and grinding.  I looked at many machines that would fit into my small first story laundry room and this was the smallest.<br />I wanted a front loader to wash comforters, pillows, and cal king bedding and this is doing it wonderfully.  It doesn't have all the fancy cycles that the others have and is not a big looker, but I wash tennis shoes, backpacks and rugs like everything.  Best part if that I no longer make the semi annual trip to the laundromat with all the bulky items.  My blacks that I wear to work, yes I work in a medical laboratory that wears black, are staying in better shape than everyone else's at work, also.<br />On another note the dryers that the company sells to match are huge also.  I can wash four mens, two womens, and six teenagers jeans at once without wrinkles after drying. If you are looking for a excellent machine that washes extremely well that also will last 20+ years this is it.<br />If you want a steam cycle with seven other cycles in a red or blue machine that will last for 8 years there are plenty of them in most appliance stores and big box stores.  If you want a machine that cleans well, is dependable and truthfully is built like a tank this brand is it.  We needed to tie the floor joists together and add a floor jack below the machine but on a cement floor this would not be necessary.<br />I have no relationship to this company but I did stop in at the dealer yesterday to tell them how happy I was with this purchase, hence this review today.",2014-09-04 14:06:44.000000000,2014,Positive,Speed Queen AFN50RS,Appliances,

B07HVSR8RF,2.0,POINTLESS - MORE WORK THAN HAND WASHING -- NOTHING LIKE REAL WASHING MACHINE,"I'm astonished that so many shoppers gave this thing a good review.  I can't begin to express how disappointed I am. It comes with tiny instructions that really don't tell you much. I had to go to the Amazon Q&A to figure out how to use it.<br /><br />This is exactly how you use it...<br /><br />1. Put cold (or if you want push it warm) water in the left half of the unit. It is small to begin with, and all the users say to fill it up half way.Do not use hot water, as it will warp the plastic. It comes with a very cheap hose that does not widen on the end, so there is no way to attach it to a faucet. I filled mine by hand with a pot.<br /><br />2. Put in your clothing.  I was able to fit one pair of teenager's jeans and two t-shirts. That maxxed it out.<br /><br />3. Add detergent.<br /><br />4. Set timer and let it swish the clothes around. I will admit it does that pretty well. The first time I used it I thought ""Hey, this is cool!""<br /><br />5. When it is done swishing, you have to drain the water using a switch. Then you have to remove the wet clothes from the left side and move it to the right side, which is the Spin Cycle. The spin part is only half the size of the washing part. So I could only spin one pair of kids jeans. And then two t-shirts. (water got all over the place during the spin cycle)<br /><br />THEN YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN....<br /><br />6. The clothing is still soapy, so you have to put water again in the left side (using my pot again) and wash it again on the left side. Then do the spin cycle again to get the water out.<br /><br />9. Then you have to hang it somewhere to dry.<br /><br />This is so much more work than just using Woolite or something and doing it a sink.<br /><br />Some other CONS -<br />It is kind of noisy, and I can not use it in my apartment. It must drive the people downstairs nuts.<br /><br />I moves around as it functions. (there's a reason real washing machines are heavy)<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />It is nothing like a true washing machine. I hope it would help us while we are trapped in our NYC apartment during the pandemic, but it was useless.<br /><br />I am returning it at some point.

B0049HE6AU,4.0,Nice Price & Working Fine... But May Require Modifications to Back Panel on SOME Model Refrigerators,"Just wanted to give a heads up for others.  This valve is working well & it's nice to have a less expensive alternative to the factory part, but installation was not that simple in my Whirlpool Gold refrigerator.<br /><br />From other reviews, it appears that this valve was a drop-in replacement for a lot of folks.  But in my Whirlpool Gold refrigerator, (model GX2FHDXVQ02) the cover/access panel had to be modified to fit.  The body of the valve is too large to fit thru the existing cut-out in the panel.  I had to enlarge the cut-out with a pair of tin snips (Be careful not to cut away the mount point for the screws) & drill an additional hole for a 2nd mounting screw.  This was simple enough to do for someone who is handy & has tools, but might be problematic for some.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-  Price<br />-  Works well (full sized cubes again..)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Necessary to modify access panel to mount this (larger) valve<br />-  Plenty of extra hardware included in the package to accomodate any water lines & connectors<br />-  Valve is is noisier than the old was  (At least in my case.  Others have said that their replacement valve was quiet, so this may vary..)",2016-02-09 22:25:09.000000000,2016,Positive,"Supco WV8047 Single Coil Outlet Water Valve Replaces Whirlpool 4318047, 12001415, 3456, 4210524, 4339671",Tools & Home Improvement,$12.95

B010BLQF1A,5.0,So much quieter than the old bearing,"These new bearings are so much quieter than the OEM bearing that were going out on our washer.  There is no way for me to be sure, but I think it spins faster now, too.  In all fairness, our washer is going on ten years old, so the old ones did last a while.  I expect these to last at least that long or until we replace this machine.  The order arrived quickly and all the contents were very well packaged.<br /><br />I watched a few vids on UToob to see how to take the machine apart. I really liked the one from Yellow Van Handyman.  He disassembled the exact model we have and offered a some great tips and tricks for taking the machine apart and removing the tub and drum assembly.<br /><br />That being said,  Make sure you watch the Front Load Bearing(sellers) videos.  There are some great tips and trick on the actual bearing removal and installation.  On my first attempt, I did not get my seal seated all the way and when I reassembled the drum and tub, the drum did not spin freely.  This was my fault and if I had watched the sellers videos first, I would have avoided this mistake.  No harm done, just extra time and a few laughs at my expense.<br /><br />HINT -- When you are driving you bearings out, I found that a standard 5 gallon bucket ( like the one the sheetrock compound comes in), works very well as a cradle and support.  There are some tabs on the joining edge of the the rear section of the tub you must not damage. The 5 gallon bucket is wide enough and tall enough to hold the tub when working on both the inner and outer bearings.<br /><br />Overall the process was easy for the average DIY person.  You may want to get some help with removing the tub and drum, it is pretty heavy and bulky.  Get a jar to put all the screws in, there are alot.  I think the only tools I needed were a 7mm socket and driver, small flat head screwdriver, large crescent wrench or socket set, large screwdriver or bar (to lock pulley in place) and a rubber mallet( although you can use a regular hammer), a piece of 2x4 and some white lithium grease.<br /><br />Just take your time and pause the videos as you work.<br /><br />BTW have a few beer cold for when you finish, because you should reward yourself for a job well done.",2016-07-06 00:49:08.000000000,2016,Positive,"Front Load Bearings Washer Tub Bearing and Seal Kit with Nachi Bearings, Fits Kenmore & Whirlpool Tub W10253864 (Includes a 5 Year Replacement Warranty and Link to Our""How to"" Videos)",Tools & Home Improvement,

B00LHR9Q2S,5.0,How to fix the smelly washing machine for good (replace hose and buy a Fan for the vent - permanent fix ),"For the smelly washing machine:  The hose is great quality btw  - replace the hose first and then you will need to buy a 115 VAC 120mmX120MMX25MM fan (eg AC Infinity AXIAL 1225, Cooling Fan, Low Speed) and buy an 120mmX92mmX80MM fan mounting adapter kit.  (eg. Akust Aluminum 80mm & 92mm to 120mm Case Fan Adapter Blue). both are available on Amazon. to add the fan:  Remove the top washing machine  cover (3 bolts on back and slide it fwd and lift off). Mount the smaller 80mm side of the adapter around the vent on back so it enclosed it.  There will be a small gap on one side and you can add a piece of rubber 3/4&#34; weather stripping ($4 dollars at lowes/Home D). After you add your weather stripping, line the holes up so you can catch metal on the washing machine.  pre drill the back of the washing machine (using slighter smaller holes thatn you mounting screws) by drilling through the 4 holes on the adapter.  Use some zinc hex screws and screw it in. Now mount the 120mm fan to the other end of the adapter.  It is a vent so you mount the motor so it exhausts and creates airflow out of the wash machine.  check arrow on fan for flow direction. (or plug it in before mounting to confirm flow direction).  Note - removal of the cover is so you can see where you are drilling so you do not drill into something you shouldn't.  This is the low speed fan that uses 8watts and they have a higher speed one with twice the CFM that use 18W and is an overkill in my opinion (too much energy usage).  Plug it into the wall and leave it on for years (do not unplug) you are leaving it on to dry out the passages to prevent mold from reoccurring. (so you want it to run 24/7).  The &#34;Washer Fan&#34; company has a patented magnet mount version that will be available in late 2016 for a $100 if you are not mechanically inclined and want to wait....  Additionally, some folks say washing with Borax with Tri Sodium Phosphate (TSP) in the HE front loaders will fix problem given the Phosphate's reaction properties with iron, sulfur,  etc",2016-04-03 20:49:52.000000000,2016,Positive,Whirlpool W10003250 Hose-Drain,Tools & Home Improvement,$22.84

B002LSO9WE,1.0,Worst Washing Machine  I've Ever Owned!,"I own a Maytag Bravos but different model# (MVW600XW). This washing machine is horrible!  The water level is so low that it doesn't even begin to cover the clothes....even when the load only has a few pieces of clothing!  The lock is very annoying and doesn't allow you to rinse the detergent cup (which causes a big mess unless you take the cup to a sink and rinse it out) and trying to add a forgotten clothing item to the wash turns into a major, time consuming ordeal.  Since there is not an agitator clothes basically just sit in the machine,  barely moving, in a very small amount of water so the clothes are never truly clean.  The instructions reccomended that you wash your Maytag washing machine every month to prevent the machine from having an odor...odd, I never had to wash my traditional washing machine to prevent it from having a bad odor....perhaps this is due to the fact that my traditional washing machine actually added water to wash my clothes!  The cycles seem to run much longer than my former washing machine (traditional, not HE) and the clothes are still not clean.  My husband and I have both had enough of this machine and made the decision to just take a loss on the money we spent on this Maytag and buy another washer...Yesterday, I ordered a traditional washing machine -that actually uses enough water to cover the clothes and an agitator that will actually move the clothes around while they wash....what a novel idea!

B0049UXKJA,4.0,Easy to Use,"I was initially drawn to this machine by it's looks, but bought it for ease of use. Samsung and LG consistently get high marks but in everyday use they drive me nuts. For those not familiar with the Asian design aesthetic, it basically goes like this: More buttons + more blinking lights + more beeping noises = more better. Well, in the words of Stan Marsh, ""I thought this was America!"" It is, Stan, and this one is actually made in America too.<br /><br />The controls are simple, just go from left to right. Set auto or timed mode, modify the default settings if you want, throw in some bonuses (like delay time), and press play. I did not really need to read the instructions to figure it out, and the silly noises can be turned off. This is also the first dryer I have ever used with an automatic dry mode that actually works. Although the modes are a bit goofy, ""more dry"" equals dry, I'm not sure how you can be more dry than dry but whatever. ""Normal dry"" equals barely damp, perfect for ironing, and ""damp"" equals damp for hang drying. It is really nice that the steamer has an actual water line, not just a tray you fill with water like many others.<br /><br />This is easily the best performing dryer I have ever used. The first time I turned it on it blew decades of old dryer lint out of my 30' long exhaust vent, and it blows out so much steam you could build a sauna around it. This thing dries quickly, usually in 40 mins. And evenly, even fitted sheets are no match. It is also very quiet. The only noise that can be heard is the burner lighting, and that is when standing right next to it.<br /><br />One final note is a weird warning on page one of the installation manual: ""Place dryer at least 18 inches above the floor for a garage installation. Failure to do so can result in death, explosion, or fire."" Now we all know garage floors are no more explosive than regular floors and I am not going to build a stand for it that is 18 inches taller than my washer, but since this little gem is not mentioned in any of the sales info I thought I'd pass it along.<br /><br />If you are buying this as a set like I did, the features of the washer and dryer to not really match up. The 6000 dryer DOES have a steam cycle and interior light, if you also want that on your washer you will need to step up to the 7000. Also, unlike the washer this dryer DOES NOT come with all of the required connectors. It only comes with the water line, you will need a gas line and exhaust vent. Please don't use a cheap-o flexible vent tube, they reduce efficiency and can create a fire hazard.",2013-02-09 05:45:26.000000000,2013,Positive,Maytag MGD6000XG,Amazon Home,

B0BTWNPT82,5.0,not a beginner project but not difficult,had all the parts to bring your drive mechanism back to new.  to do this you pretty much have to completely dismantle the dryer so you can pull the drum out.  I used a cart lift because  some if the work is at the bottom and it makes it easy to adjust the height ad I dismantled  and rebuilt the unit.  youtube video will help if you have never done this.  it's a rewarding project that's not too difficult but take a lot of time.  plan on 4 hours if you have never done it before.  take pictures as you disassemble it so you can remember everything you took apart.  I also bought new weather stripping and replaced all the workout seals while I worked on it.  I also spent a good deal of time just vacuuming the lent and fuzz in the machine.  I'll bet there are 50 screws you pull out to disassemble this.  in the end I figure I saved close to $300 doing it myself.,2023-03-08 14:39:55.727999926,2023,Positive,4392067 Dryer Repair Kit Replacement Parts by B&C Ecom LLC,Tools & Home Improvement,$36.99

Pro tip: Hang the drum by the belt as they show in the YouTube videos, then put it into the machine. Drop the belt. OPEN THE ACCESS PANEL ON THE BACK! Take a pic of the video that clearly shows the way the belt feeds around the loop with your cell phone camera. Use the pic to make sure you thread it correctly. It takes about 30 seconds to install, pushing the tensioner pulley to the side and then slipping the belt over the idler. Also, be sure that it does -not- fall into the groove in the drum. There will be a worn area just outside that groove that indicates the correct belt position.<br /><br />Now, if only the glides didn't use pop-rivets!",2015-06-19 23:55:23.000000000,2015,Positive,Whirlpool Y312959 Dryer Belt,Tools & Home Improvement,$13.55

B00DM8KL1A,3.0,Drive block was machined slightly off-center- hopefully a rare issue,"Had an unexpected surprise; the part was correct for my washer and installed OK, but I noticed that the spin basket seemed to wobble more than it had, causing an imbalance & minor cabinet shaking. I had an all-new drive system otherwise (center support, basket drive, clutch, etc). The machined hole in the cast drive block was basically about 30 thousands off-center, which caused the wobble. I could see this with the spin basket removed and just the drive block spinning by itself. I went to a local store and bought another block (grrr, 3x Amazon price) and it was fine. We micrometer'd both of them, with one mic jaw flat against the small conical taper at the bottom. The empty basket should have none to a bit of imbalance when spinning, but not as much as I saw. Both blocks were sealed in Whirlpool factory service parts (FSP) bags - I noted that the new one's bag said made in USA, which surprised both me and the counterman. I'd tossed the old bag. Each block had slightly different mold stampings so they were made at different locations. No blame on Amazon; the part was genuine and it was more than 30 days before I could get to it. So, if you've had a mystery imbalance since new or after a repair, check this part. A symptom is that the holes in the bottom of the spin basket won't be tracking in a neat circle but will sort of blur out as the wobble sets in.",2016-02-20 02:41:29.000000000,2016,Neutral,Whirlpool 389140 Drive,Tools & Home Improvement,$13.54

B0046X5ZC0,1.0,TERRIBLE! DO NOT BUY IT EVER!!,"After having an ancient Maytag work-horse finally die after more than 30 years of loyal trouble-free service, I assumed that a new eco-friendly Maytag would be fantastic.  How wrong I was! This is the worst washing machine I have ever experienced.  It is a piece of junk!  I can't imagine that Maytag is not ashamed to put its name on a machine that is so bad.  It is unbelievably noisy, downright scary, making very loud sawing, creaking, metallic grinding, clicking, alien noises when it is ""sensing"" and ""locking the lid"" and for every other cycle. Although the bin is very large, you can't put much laundry in it since it has to be evenly ""placed"" around the imaginary non-existent agitator in the center.  It supposedly is eco-friendly and does not need much water, but it sadly does not get the clothes clean. It tangles and can rip the clothes.  It does not spin at all if it has a normal size load as the clothes get wet and become too heavy for it to spin at all. Then you can try to use a special ""drain and spin"" cycle, but that also does not work and it still does not spin. If you put in anything like a quilt, dog beds, small cushion, etc. it does not spin at all or starts banging the tub inside against the sides of the washing machine making the loudest, scariest sounds you have ever heard. I am returning it immediately and now will never buy a Maytag again, since they obviously do not care what garbage they are making and selling. This is truly a sad story of a formerly quality brand name of appliances that is ""Made in America"", but is now just awful quality. Calling it a ""WASHING MACHINE"" is not accurate, since it does not wash or spin clothes. Is it really so hard to design a product that actually works?  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE PRODUCT!  I was duped by the brand name.....don't make the same mistake.",2013-02-02 22:24:43.000000000,2013,Negative,Maytag MVWC400XW Centennial 3.6 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Appliances,

B01G5GB2NQ,5.0,Nice ice maker.  Flawless performance!,"My refrigerator is not near a water line so making ice must be done with ice cube trays or an ice making machine.  This ice machine reliably cranks out ice for home use.  By no means is this made for commercial use but to fill several glasses of ice for a meal, with more left over, it's great.  I have only used the small setting which seems to fit glasses well.  Of course, you can always bag ice ahead of time and keep it in your freezer for occassions where you'll need a several bags.  The chamber where the ice is kept is insulated but not refrigerated so the ice will eventually melt.  However the water reservoir is below the vented ice basket so the water simply refreezes into more ice.

B005KT4LK6,1.0,Don't walk. RUN away from this piece of GARBAGE,"We had an agitator washer for a long time. The Dog Agits wore out and I replaced them so it worked ok. However my wife wanted a new one. We did some research and bought a WTW7300X about 2 1/2 years ago. BIG mistake. It's been SO frustrating that if there was such a thing as a time machine, we'd use it to go back in time and buy something else. Two weeks after we got it, the computer board failed. The first tech blamed it on the water feed hoses being clogged. He had NO clue what was wrong and left. Second tech replaced the computer board which solved the problem. We've had CONTINUAL &#34;unbalanced load&#34; issues so we can't run it at night because you never know if it's going to complete a cycle. I estimate 30% of the time we get a &#34;UL&#34; regardless of how it's loaded or what's in it. 30 days short of two years the tub bearing failed. Fortunately we'd bought it with a CC that extended the warranty for a year so the repair was ok'd by the warranty company. The repair tech said that bearing failure was a common problem but was supposed to have been fixed. Guess not. Shortly after that when we lifted the lid there was a loud &#34;clunking&#34; noise near the lid hinge. I determined that the lid spring assembly had come loose and had to retighten it on both sides. When I opened it up to fix the springs, the underside of the top was filled with rust. Water splashes up under the top and stays there, eventually rusting the top. Now clothes are coming out with dark stains on them. It looks like oil and I suspect that the bearing is failing again. And it's also torn some of our son's clothes. So PLEASE save yourselves a LOT of pain and frustration. Don't buy a Cabrio. April 10, 2014 Update. Last night there was rusty water on the floor under the washer. The problem I mentioned about water splashing up under the top at the bleach dispenser apparently happens continuously. There's another review here that addresses the same problem. You just don’t notice it until enough water runs down the inside of the washer over time and then overflows from the frame at the bottom. Now the top left side is rusted almost all the way from front to back. There should ba a gasket on the top of the tub funnel tp prevent this from happening. Now, the paint’s bubbling and all the hose clamps are rusty. So you have this to look forward to if you have one of these. Whoever designed it should be FIRED.

It's actually<br />18 x 16.75 x 17<br />H x W x D<br /><br />This is the only one we found that actually had an upper spray head for the top drawer that holds utensils and such.<br />We use it on average once sometimes twice a day. We must always use the standard cycle with a dry feature. The dishes always come out dry except for the food container lids which sometimes have a little water left inside but that is normal for any dryer. Once you get to know how to load it it takes a few days things come out clean almost every single time. We use Cascade complete plus oxy and slightly overfill the very small detergent container. We found them by slightly overfilling it so that the detergent kind of mounds up it always cleans the dishes perfectly. We tried using all the brand dish detergent and it did not do near as well. I found you can stack cooking utensils and things on top of certain items just make sure that there is some sort of flow from the lower spray head. One word of warning is to always watch when it first starts to make sure the upper and lower spray head are spinning and are not blocked from moving. We always fill the dishwasher from the top because the faucet hook up must stay connected through the entire 69 minute cycle because it refills multiple times for rinsing but you only have to fill it once if you use the included jug.<br />We have had the washer for 11 months now without issue or leakage.<br /><br />I will try to remember to update this review when it stops working.",2023-05-06 15:34:09.765000105,2023,Positive,"Portable Countertop Dishwasher, 5 Washing Programs, Built-in 3-Cups Water Tank, 3D Cyclone Spray, Fruit & Vegetable Cleaning with Basket, High Temperature, Air Drying - Lights, Faucet Adapter Included",Appliances,$308.00

B07H1F8JXJ,2.0,"Samsung range model NE58F9500SS can use this part too- updated, did not hold up","I had ordered the official Samsung part over a month ago and Samsung didn't have it in stock and missed the estimated date 3 times.  So I took a chance and ordered this part because it looked similar and came up with a search of my model number even though that model number is not listed in the product description.  There's a bigger flange on this part but the part that makes contact fits in the opening.  The original part was only held in with one screw so I just kinda wiggled it in and fastened the one screw, plugged the oven back in and it fired right up.  Put the oven back together and have baked two batches of muffins and roasted a pan of veggies.  Works great.  Will never use the stupid self clean feature again.  Also, Youtube is the only thing that made this repair possible.  God bless those people that post their repairs.<br />UPDATE:  Worked perfectly for a few months, but now it doesn't regulate the oven heat at all.  Discovered when I tried to bake a cake at 350 and it jumped up to 500.  Been using a digital thermometer to test and the oven is always at least 150 degrees over what it reads.

B00L03WH7A,3.0,STK Reusable K-Cups - Study In Progress,"As an engineer, I liked the overall design of the STK Reusable K-Cups based on what one could gather online. An o-ring on the lid prevents the grounds from escaping the cup while brewing. The lid takes some effort close but the cup is sturdy enough to withstand the force needed to close it. The cut-outs n the sidewalls certainly allow the brewed coffee to escape the cup more freely than the single hole a standard K-Cup provides. In theory I agree with the mfg. that this could provide a more robust cup of coffee.<br /><br />My wife and I's experience is limited to about 3 weeks of occasional use at this point. The brewed coffee turns out well. Clean up is minimal after dumping out the wet grounds and allowing the remainder in the cup dry before trying to remove them.<br /><br />We purchased our first Keurig coffee maker (model 145) 3 weeks ago so we are relative neophytes to the Keurig world. Our first machine died after 12 days - will write more about this experience in a review of that machine - it could no longer force water through even a standard K-Cup to brew coffee. However, without a cup the water flowed through the machine. I am not yet familiar with the mechanism(s) and process the Keurig machine uses to regulate the force of the hot water through the K-Cup while brewing. Until I am I have reservations about what caused our first machine to fail. I have not ruled out the use of the STK K-Cup for causing the failure. Until I can be sure that the plastic strainer in the lid of the STK does not restrict the water flow during brewing, thus possibly requiring more water force than the Keurig was designed to handle my rating will remain at 3 stars.<br /><br />My background as an electrical engineer means that I need to perform additional research on the mechanical design and properties involved before I will be able to deliver an accurate verdict on this product and the Keurig machine design. I will update this review after I am satisfied with my research and conclusions... I welcome inputs from those who have had similar or dissimilar experiences with their Keurig and the STK K-Cups, please include data that includes: Model Keurig used, average use and age of the machine; how frequently you use the STK cups and how many weeks/months/years you have done so; any other observations you may think are relevant.",2015-04-01 14:59:47.000000000,2015,Neutral,"STK Keurig Reusable K Cups- 3Pack for Classic and 2.0 Brewers Universal Fit for K55, K575, K15, K250, K-Elite, K155, K-Select, K475",Amazon Home,

That grease alone is a $28 FSP part (350849).. I've read where waterproof grease can be used (e.g., marine grease), so that's what I got instead.<br /><br />Final word:<br />- I should have just bought the agits and saved myself a couple bucks. The old cam would have lived on, I suppose.<br />- For what should be a 15-30 minute repair job, when not all the needed parts are correct or supplied it takes much longer.

I would have opted for higher quality bearings if available because the removal job is difficult compared to the cost of the bearings.<br /><br />I have an ~10 year old LG Direct Drive washer which has had the ‘all plastic rotor hub’ (4413ER) replaced many times.  I assume that’s due to an engineering mishap on LG’s behalf since they upgraded the dampening ‘all plastic hub’ with a metal insert one that hasn’t failed yet.  Only problem with that is it puts pulsation from the Direct Drive VFD’s magnetic forces directly on the bearings.  I think this causes seal fatigue and the bearings to fail prematurely.  I have to give TOMOON / wsh supplier credit as they did stand behind their ""5 YEARS WARRANTY"".  They shipped a whole rebuild kit under warranty very quickly.

Great design, high quality, double walled and seals well. My machine makes the same high pressure sound when I put this amount of coffee in it as if I used the illy iperpresso capsule. I do get a good creama. Makes a great espresso.<br />Two more tips: if the water rushes through too easily without the high bar pressure sound that means either your coffee is ground too large or you need a little more coffee in the capsule to fill air gaps.<br />I highly recommend this capsule.

B007G3NX1W,3.0,"Ok, but could be better","I bought the eco-egg mini washing machine about two weeks ago and have it used 3 times. It clean as expected but there a few things that could be better, so I gave it 3 stars and I will explain why.<br /><br />I took 1 start from it due to the following: After washing the clothes, the machine throw the water out, but after removing the clothes from inside of it, I always have some residual water inside. Since it does not have a button that I can press to activate its mechanism to throw that residual water away, I need to remove the water by hand (If you close you eco-egg with water inside, the next time you open it it will be with a bad smell inside). I cannot assure that the residual water inside the machine is due to not effective draining system or due to the water that came out the clothes when I remove them from inside. Yes, when the machine finishes the cleaning cycle, your clothes you will be full of water since the machine does not have a spin dryer mechanism (as a normal washing machine). That spin dryer function is something that I really miss.<br /><br />The other star that I took is to its installation mechanism. When I bought it, I though that I would simply plug the water in hose in my water tap, but you actually have to remove a piece that is inside the water tap (at least, the majority of water tap has that piece installed). So, every time that I would use, I need to remove that piece from my water tap and insert a specific piece (that comes with the machine) in the tap.<br /><br />In sum, if you are looking for a mini washing machine to clean your clothes and you mainly don't mind having to squeeze your clothes after the cleaning, this machine will work for you.",2012-10-13 18:26:59.000000000,2012,Neutral,Eco-egg Automatic Mini Washing Machine (Pink & White),Appliances,

A part that suppose to fit; would go back on with ease. In no way I’m I doggie or blaming the seller in this case. This was all my fault. Honestly, when it  got there and didn’t fit I was just sick of working on my washer and dryer and decided to buy new. My advice is this.  Buy genuine parts. I always have and not once did I have to return. Again, to make this clear this seller send the part. It arrived on time. They had nothing to do with the product not fitting and it being made cheap. Unless they made the part themselves. To the seller I would take that model off the description because I’m not a beginner in working on washer and dryers.

I never have to worry about boil-over from the soy milk. I never have to squeeze a bag of nut milk, which always makes a huge mess. All I have to do is strain the finished product with the strainer which is included. Also, there are lots of recipes online from the maker of this machine.

B07XXTJP29,5.0,Works well & reasonably priced,"I have ordered these ""Anpro 24K Gold K Cup Reusable Coffee Filter for use on all Keurig 2.0 Brewer Models, use on K200, K300, K400 and, K500 Series brewers(Black, 3)"" twice from seller 'Anpro US' for two different prices in the range of $5 to $7. They were ""Sold by Anpro US and Fulfilled by Amazon"" and arrived with the rest of the things I had ordered both times, as one would expect from something that is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"". I have been happy with them so far, enough that I ordered that second box of them. They seem to work as well as the other refillable k-cups that I have used and these have the advantage of being larger and thus holding more coffee grounds so that I can brew a 16oz travel mug of coffee. The construction is very similar to the 'cheap' generic re-usable k-cups, but they look and feel like the materials are better -- the black plastic seems a bit more rigid and the gold filter material is less flexible and slightly more restrictive than the gray screens on the others reusable k-cups I have but so far this has only been noticable when washing them out. I haven't used them enough yet to comment on their durability. The box came with a tiny scoop which might be useful for measuring grounds for a consistent brew (since there are 3 different sized cups), a tiny brush I haven't needed, and there was a nicely printed product information card and a customer service card with the company's email address. The product looks good and professional, not like cheap junk; I'd feel comfortable giving a box of these as a gift. For the price I paid ($5-7 for a box of 3 cups) these seem to be a good bargain when compared to the pricey official Keurig version and even when compared to the 'cheap' generic re-usable k-cups which seem to cost about $1-1.50 each when bought in quantity.",2020-07-04 21:32:20.253000021,2020,Positive,"Anpro Reusable Coffee Filter for use on all Keurig 2.0 Brewer Models, use on K200, K300, K400 and, K500 Series brewers",Amazon Home,

B00B8YSQOE,3.0,UPDATE ON PURCHASE,"UPDATE: 1/3/2017 -<br /><br />The lint filter in my dryer started falling off while the dryer was running. I called the number in the product book and was asked to give my email. They did contact me via my email address and ended up sending me a replacement filter. The new one still fell off. I contacted them again via email reply to the original email conversation and they sent me the plastic part that the filter goes on; still didn't work. In the meantime while waiting for the part, the dryer started making a crunching noise behind the filter. Each time I used the dryer it got louder. I contacted the company via email with a video of the dryer running so they could hear the noise.<br /><br />They sent me an email that I would receive a new dryer, I just needed to cut the power cord on the original dryer and send a picture, which I did. I investigated the noise in the broken dryer before sending it to recycling and the metal on the inside of the dryer, right behind the plastic part that holds the lint filter, is completely shredded.<br /><br />I was happy to receive the email that I would be receiving a new dryer, unfortunately, the replacement dryer doesn't work. It runs but the drum does not turn. There were two dents in the new dryer as well. I assume this was damaged due to shipping.<br /><br />I am now awaiting a response from emails that I have sent regarding getting a replacement for the replacement.<br /><br />I received the dryer on Saturday (1/30/2016) and I really like it. I tried to register the product, as stated on the ownership registration but the link provided does not work. I called the company and was told that it is not necessary to register the product but to keep the information if I need to use the warranty. The customer service rep that I just spoke to barely spoke English and literally told me there is no need to register this product? Why would they put a registration card in if you don't register it? How will I know if there is a recall or other safety concerns?<br /><br />I am 50/50 happy on this. The dryer is very cute and works great so far!

I didn't have walking problems unless my top-loading washer became seriously imbalanced while washing a comforter or load of towels.<br /><br />I installed a new vinyl floor and purchased these pads mostly to protect the new floor and raise the machines a bit. They work great with my dryer but have made the washer almost unusable because even slight imbalances become greatly amplified during the spin cycle.<br /><br />Previously, I think the washer would slide a bit across the linoleum to help compensate for imbalances while spinning.

B073VKD8WJ,5.0,Easy DIY replacement,"I replaced my cogs, motor coupling, and clutch assembly. Below is my review for that, just in case it's helpful. If you're lucky enough to be doing the cogs only, it's really easy to do. Go watch a video or two on YouTube and you'll be all set. I noticed a substantial improvement in the agitator when I replaced my cogs, even though they weren't broken or completely worn out yet. It's a cheap and really easy way to get better performance from your washer.<br /><br />There are great YouTube videos online showing you how to do this and you absolutely must watch a few of them before you try this. My washer made a grinding noise and didn't spin the drum or agitate. I've had this washer for about 13 years and this is the first repair I've had to make, other than the time a sock somehow got into the pump. It has had very heavy use for all of its life so I'm not surprised it broke. I believe the root cause of my failure was the direct drive motor coupling but I'm not sure because it may also have been something in the clutch assembly because I did see some significant wear. Also, my agitator cogs were quite worn and I noticed a substantial improvement in the vigor of the agitator after I swapped them out.<br /><br />I decided to replace the clutch assembly, direct drive motor shaft coupling, and the agitator dogs/cogs. I bought all the items on Amazon and once I had them together, I began my adventure. I didn't remove the metal shell around the washer tub like I see in the videos, I just tipped it back, drained the water out, and did all the work from the bottom and inside the drum.<br /><br />Again, watch videos on YouTube. I pity the fool who tries this without looking at videos and hopefully you're more adept with appliances than I am. Aside from my pictures, these are my tips to others:<br /><br />Picture 1-3) The motor couplings I purchased were very tight fitting. I think they were likely machined to the same size and they don't, in any way, just slip on. I used a short spark plug socket end from my toolset and a hammer to get both motor couple ends on and it was vigorous hammering. The old one popped off fairly easily from the motor end, which I could see where the metal ring inside the coupling splintered or did something bad. Aligning the two couplings with the black rubber intermediary worked better for me when I put it on the motor end and then slid it onto the transmission. Also, older models may not have a metal reinforced piece inside the white nylon portion but mine did so be aware it might look different than the picture.<br /><br />Picture 4-5) Replacing the clutch assembly requires dropping the transmission and the drive shaft out the bottom of the washer and you have to remove some pieces inside the drum. Keep track of what piece goes where because I managed to get my pieces out of order, only to realize the locking ring I thought went in the drum was actually in the clutch assembly. I got to redo the entire replacement process and I wasn't happy about it. I was a lot faster the second time though.<br /><br />Final thoughts - be prepared to get dirty. Lots of grease, pet hair, and nastiness accumulates. This translated to me not being able to watch the YouTube videos as I went along. I wore gloves for some of it because of the sharp edges of the sheet metal but needed more dexterity so took them off and got nasty. Slot about an hour or two for this work max.",2021-02-23 19:13:22.045000076,2021,Positive,(2023 Update) 4 Packs 80040 Washer Agitator Dogs Replacement Kit by BlueStars - Easy to Install - Exact Fit for Whirlpool & Kenmore Washers - Replaces 285612 285770 3366877 387091,Tools & Home Improvement,$5.99

B01M67NWK1,5.0,Don’t Stress Over It,"I bought a brand new scratch & Dent Maytag dryer from Lowe’s really cheap but the salesman said someone stole the lint trap and gave me the number to call to get a new one. Well, they were back ordered for up to 4 weeks. The salesman I’m sure knew that already and didn’t tell me.<br />I read through so many reviews on here to get a decent one until my other one arrived.<br /><br />I can honestly say there really is no difference, they are both durable and made out of the strength materials. The only minor difference is the screen itself, not the plastic around the screen, is just a bit wider. You can see in the pic where the screen has some indentations, that is telling that the screen is a bit wider. The screen is strong, And I don’t see that being an issue, unless maybe over a period of time it will wear out in that spot. I’m not using it anymore because I received my Maytag one.<br /><br />The Maytag screen seems to not be as sturdy, the plastic is thinner and when I take the lint off it is floppier, if that makes sense. Overall this one seems sturdier but I am not an appliance expert. So just buy it if you need one.

I bought the 3 year extended warranty... a bit over $200....the unit is quite heavy, and two men would be needed to service it....one service call would likely exceed the cost of the warranty.  The oven seems to do a good job.  I bought an oven liner, cut it to fit the lowest shelf, do not place liner on the floor of the even.  One additional comment, took a bit of time to plumb the microwave to the oven....this two units, a microwave attached to the oven by two brackets, and there must have been a little play between the two.

B07GVPN4M6,3.0,"it works, for a while, then same problem","This is the classic issue with these control boards. You'll probably see it scattered around if you search. When you press start it does a double beep 3 times in a row and flashes the front light orange and fails to start. It will do this incessantly until you press and hold the start button to cancel. Sometimes when the dishwasher enters this state you can turn it off at the breaker for a few hours and then turn it on and it will work again, but eventually it stops working completely.<br /><br />I got this one as a replacement and it worked flawlessly for a few months, and then the problem started showing up again. No click on start, beep beep beep.  Now it's failed within the 1 year limited warranty and I need to get a new board. Luckily, they aren't that expensive and it takes an hour or two to replace with basic tools. It's cheaper than getting a whole new dishwasher.<br /><br />About the 1 year limited warranty. Don't even bother trying. You'll just go in circles. You can't return it through GE (even though the link says that's how you're supposed to) because you didn't buy it through GE parts center or their 1 authorized parts seller. You can't return it through Amazon, because it directs you back to GE, so you end up going in circles. The 1 year limited warranty is a bit of a scam and has no affect. You *might* be able to force credit return through your credit card, and that's the approach I'm going to try, even though there's nowhere conceivable that I can mail the board and it'll probably cost me $15 in shipping. Is it worth the hassle for $100? *shrug*<br /><br />Anyway, part works, but it'll likely fail again in a year or less and you'll have to do it again. If you are not the handy type, you might pay extra to get it through an authorized repair center with a warranty.",2022-12-02 16:33:15.789000034,2022,Neutral,GE Appliances WD21X23462 Dishwasher User Interface,Appliances,$103.00

The space is great and for an organizational girl like myself - it has lots of areas to compartmentalize things and easy access to drawers.  HOWEVER . . . I HATE that I've only had it 2 years and it's now the 2nd time my compressor has gone out on it . . . in the last 8 months.  If you look for reviews online - you will see that this is a VERY COMMON issue with LG refrigerators.  Our repair technician said they receive calls all the time for this problem.  The compressors regularly go out due to the poor way they are made to work.  If you purchase an LG refrigerator - BE SURE to buy the longest warranty you can get - and plan on the frustration of losing food and living out of a mini fridge or coolers for at least 2 weeks (speaking from our 2x's of experience now.)  It's a big bummer - cause I LOVE this style of fridge.,2018-09-04 15:08:11.003000021,2018,Negative,LG Diamond Collection 22.7 Cubic Feet Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator,Appliances,$4946.40

B002I9O88Q,1.0,"Or better yet, make a cooktop that doesn't turn off ...","Don't...<br />buy a Bosch induction cooktop until Bosch explains the conditions that cause the cooktop to automatically shut off at some arbitrary time during use.  This applies to the 500-series, 800-series and Flexinduction models.  I discovered this can happen while reading manuals during my web research on induction cooktops.<br /><br />Here are the respective web pages and page numbers advising of this stipulation in each model's &#34;Use and Care&#34; manual:<br /><br />500-series:<br />http://i.sears.com/s/d/pdf/mp-tc/spinpdf/spin_prod_975580612<br />(page 14)<br /><br />800-series:<br />http://i.sears.com/s/d/pdf/mp-tc/spinpdf/spin_prod_975587312<br />(page 16)<br /><br />Flexinduction:<br />http://www.goedekers.com/assets/PDF/Bosch/bosch-nitp666suc-use-and-care-manual.pdf<br />(page 15)<br /><br />I called Bosch Customer Support 5 times over a two-week period and each time talked to a different rep including a Support Supervisor on my last call.  I asked for an explanation about the specific circumstances under which the cooktop would shut off.  I cited several examples of cooking situations where one would not want the cooktop to &#34;just turn off&#34; on its own.  On my last 4 conversations with Bosch support reps, I was told they would research the issue and &#34;get back to me with an answer&#34;.<br /><br />Well, they didn't get back to me, and I still don't have an answer.  The support people don't know and further, they told me they don't communicate with Bosch engineering (who certainly would know the answer).  How strange is that?  But I was copied on an email from a Bosch Senior Support Representative to &#34;an unknown at Bosch&#34;.  The email contained the following exact wording from one of the manuals:<br />&#34;Automatic time limitation<br />If the element is used for prolonged periods of time without changes in the settings being made, the automatic time limitation function is triggered. The element stops heating. &#34;F8&#34; and the residual heat indicator &#34;H/h&#34; flash alternately in the display. The indicator goes out when any symbol is pressed. The element can now be reset. When the automatic time limitation is activated depends on the selected heat level (from 1 to 10 hours).&#34;<br /><br />The email also briefly revealed that &#34;a customer&#34; (me) wanted to know the conditions that can cause the cooktop to shut off, but didn't offer any relevant explanations.  Whatsoever!  I was told by a couple of support reps that the cooktop turns off for &#34;safety reasons&#34; but no other details were offered.  Safety reasons?  Really?  Does that mean the cooktops are nearing a dangerous state?  Are these Bosch cooktops the only cooktops ever made that turn off  &#34;for safety reasons&#34;  Maybe, but if so, I'm not aware of any others.<br /><br />I hope I am not alone in thinking Bosch needs to inform prospective customers exactly what conditions can trigger these (expensive) cooktops to shut off?  Or better yet, just make a cooktop that doesn't arbitrarily turn off.<br /><br />Bottom line is, buy one of these Bosch cooktops only if you are willing to risk it automatically turning off sometime between &#34;1 and 10 hours&#34;.  Or, if you'd be content to just stand watch over it to be sure it stays on while you're cooking a corned-beef for 4-5 hours.<br /><br />Bosch engineers take notice!",2015-05-06 16:30:25.000000000,2015,Negative,"Bosch 500 Series NIT5665UC 36"" Black with Stainless Steel Trim Induction Cooktop with SteelTouch",Amazon Home,

B0047Q3K5K,1.0,Product may be good but I'll never know because Price Pros stuck me with a broken item,"I purchased this vent hood due to the good price and apparent good feedback.  We are renovating our kitchen and received the vent hood 32 days ago.  To keep it safe we left it in the box until we were ready to install it.  When we opened the box the glass was completely shattered.  After contacting the company the only response they gave was this... ""Thank you for contacting The Price Pros.  We received your request for return, however we are unable to process your request at this time.  Per our return policy, we will accept a return of a defective or non-defective item, for credit or replacement, if notified within 30 days from receiving the item. Since it is past our 30 days return policy time frame, you may contact the manufacture of the item for further assistance.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any concerns or questions you may have.""  Trying to call them I sat on hold for 30 minutes before giving up and subsequent e-mails received the exact same canned message.  Granted I was 2 days past the warranty period but this unit was delivered damaged.  A call to the manufacturer Broan-Nutone got the response ""We never heard of  Price Pros ... it could have been bought and transferred many times before being sent to you"".  A call to American Express got the response ""since it was delivered to you already damaged we don't cover it under the buyer protection coverage"".  So at this point my only recourse is with the shipper and if they say I broke it somehow then back to American Express.  All in all I wanted to share this experience - an expensive $900 lesson not to purchase from Price Pros and to reconsider buying expensive items from Amazon.  Amazon.com was no help at all.  Boo Hoo on Price Pros - it is apparent they are one of those companies that I try to avoid with my due diligence of checking feedback etc but in the end somehow got sucked in by the price.

Now These filters will work, they just won't last half as long.  The brand name came with these stickers that turned red when it was time to replace. These filters don't have that, just replace regularly. Given this is so much cheaper than brand name, only 6 months or more could I say if replacing them twice as often is cheaper or not. For those of you who don't know what this thing does, you know how your fruits and vegetables are going bad quicker? That's probably not lower quality produce, it's most likely the carbon filter needs to be replaced. I've noticed good carbon, blueberries and strawberries will last 2-3 weeks. With no or dead carbon , starts going bad in a couple days.

B004L44EVC,4.0,"the price is great, it looks expensive but it is not","First, I will tell you the Pros:. This is an outstanding hood, the price is great, it looks expensive but it is not, the stainless is magnetic, It has three fan speeds with an 8 inch exhaust discharge, It replaced a microwave that did a poor job of exhausting fumes and smoke from the range, The hood arrived promptly in perfect condition. It has grates that can be washed in the dish washer and also  has a grease drip bar in the back. Operation of the light and three different fan speed are fairly simple. The fan is programmed whereby you can turn it off immediately or let it continue for one minute and then turn off.<br /><br />Cons: I would have given this hood a five star rating except for the operation of the clock! Setting the normal clock time is complicated and I  had to call the business that sold the hood for instructions and they even had a little difficulty explaining things. The clock reads all time in 24 hour stages which I call Military time, for example 11 PM is 2300 hours. There is no way  the set the mode of the clock to 12 am and 12 pm.<br />I don't use the clock anyway because I have a clock on the coffee maker, a clock on the microwave, a clock on the range, and a clock on the wall of the kitche. I don't have one on the fridge, but when I replace that, I probably will have one alreadyh installed.",2016-05-13 21:32:55.000000000,2016,Positive,"AKDY 30"" Under Cabinet Stainless Steel LED Display Touch Control Panel Kitchen Vent Fan Range Hood & Remote Control",Amazon Home,

I’m a big pizza oven gal, and there’s even a setting on the oven for pizza. Only struggles that I have had were my previous plug had three prongs And I needed a four prong electrical outlet, And I put my gas line converter on upside down so I wasn’t getting any gas into the stove and had to have a plumber come out and switch it around for me.

B00WKLSQ7G,1.0,"Sludgy Coffee, Low filter area, lots of plastic, but Beautiful Dolphins to look at.","I ordered these because they fit into my MR Coffee Keurig maker. For my main Keurig maker, I use another product with a gold filter, so I had something to compare to. The coffee made with this filter came out sludgy with poor taste. Also, in order to fit the maker, the bottom portion is indented, and it makes it very hard to clean the coffee out. You have to used your finger or the edge of a spoon to stir up the coffee. My other filter just washes right out with the faucet. My biggest concern is this design. Instead of the filters being full filter around the sides of the cup, there is intervening plastic. I do not understand this design, and when looking for a replacement I noted many other ones for sale also have this design. With this design boiling hot coffee filters and then runs over plastic before exiting the unit. After a little while, I noticed that the plastic is placed in such a way to create a design out of the filter -  2 dolphins swimming!!!  Do we really need a dolphin design to make a cup of coffee, how about maximizing the filtering area to produce a better cup of coffee.

Very handy to not have to find a store that sells the filter, but instead to have it delivered to my door.  It was very easy to verify that the filter would fit my appliance and then just as easy to order it.  The instructions on how to remove the old filter and then how to put in the new filter are printed right on the side of the box and were very easy to understand and to follow.  I will definitely purchase this filter again from this Seller when this one needs to be replaced.<br /><br />I have ordered and received my second one of these filters, again at a greatly reduced price than I would have had to pay at a regular store.  The original filter is still going strong, the idiot light has not even gone to amber yet, so this filter definitely lasts just as long as the filter you would buy at a store.

I didn't know if this washer would work out but I was willing to take the risk. Turns out it is perfect. It works well for my needs... Baby clothes need to be washed often so I throw in a load usually every other day and the size capacity of this washer accommodates that perfectly. It's super easy to use and unlike portable washers my friends have bad in the past, it doesn't short circuit my apartment. Some things to keep in mind: this thing sucks at collecting lint; I am currently in search for solutions to this and I am confident I will find something. Also, the washer isn't super loud but it isn't quiet and it takes about 45 mins per load including the spin cycle (taking into account how long it takes water to fill up and drain and the cycles).<br />I would def recommend this machine for anyone with a baby or small kids; perfect for their laundry.",2016-07-03 16:30:35.000000000,2016,Positive,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine(10lbs Capacity) XPB45 -Larger Size,Appliances,

B018D73X5A,5.0,Not a 38/400 thread pattern like real growlers!,"Update: The seller contacted my and went above and beyond to correct the error, changing the listing and shipping me a replacement product for free. If you are okay with the thread pattern this growler will work well for you. Hopefully someone will build a carbonating cap for it in the near future. If they do I'll buy this again because honestly the thread pattern would be better for carbonating than the standard 38/400.<br /><br />Here is my previous review: It is a single walled stainless bottle, so no insulation to keep the contents cold. While it does look small it holds 64 oz, but with no head space. It has one critical flaw for people interested in using it as a growler though: the thread size of the cap is non-standard! The standard growler thread pattern is 38/400 while this one has some metric thread I've never come across. The lid diameter is indeed 38 mm but a standard growler cap won't fit as the thread pattern is much too fine. I had planned to carbonate in this growler using a 38/400 carbonation cap and Das Beer clearly answers a customer question posted above about the cap size saying it is 38 mm. Either they are deliberately trying to mislead customers (unlikely) or they just don't know much about home brewing beer in America. The manufacturer is likely a Chinese company that just received an order for bottles with a 38 mm cap and they just used their normal metric thread pitch rather than considering the end user. The growler seems to be constructed well and if you are just going to use it as a water bottle you should be fine, just don't lose the cap!",2017-03-21 21:36:33.000000000,2017,Positive,Stainless Steel Keg Style Growler,Appliances,

B000H27X92,3.0,Adequate but More Thought and Better Customer Service would Help,"Ovens are supposed to heat…pretty prosaic.  But there are high-end ovens that throw in bells and whistles and you pay a premium for them.  So, how’s a consumer to know if an oven is worth its premium price?  Hopefully a review like this helps.<br /><br />Some of this may seem like nit-picking, but if you are paying for an oven to do more than just be hot, it could be helpful for you to know the goods and the not-so-goods.<br /><br />This is about the Miele H4890.  Yes, it does heat.  But what else would you want from a high-end oven?  Reliability?  Good customer service?  A rotisserie?  Easy to clean?<br /><br />First, customer service:  Customer service eventually answers you, but it’s difficult and frustrating.  I waited more than a month to write this review because I wanted to make sure I was not writing only out of annoyance.  My attempts to reach customer service were answered by giving me an email address that bounces emails and a customer service group that told me on more than one occasion they did not get my request.  The Miele website for this oven offers no information (it results in a blank page).  Just for the heck of it, I checked again and it is still that way…more than a month after I told Miele that it appears that something wasn't working.<br /><br />The rotisserie is unusual in this oven.  There are two within the oven cavity and they are both mounted so that you place the spit in the same direction as the depth of the oven instead of from side-to-side, along its width.  This may be a good idea but because there are two of them and because the depth of the oven is less than its width, you are limited to what you can put on the rotisserie.  The spits are so close to the sides that anything larger than a very large chicken might not fit.<br /><br />The way the spits are inserted into the interior motor creates a minor inconvenience.  The spits mount so that drippings go into the drip pan (good) but the grill racks are needed to mount the spits properly.  This means that drippings from the roast not only go into the drip pan but they also go onto the grill racks creating just one more thing to clean.  More about that later.<br /><br />Also, you cannot use the rotisserie at less than 400 F.  Why?  I don’t know.<br /><br />The drip pans and the grill racks use what Miele calls a proprietary “Perfect Clean” technology.  It’s supposed to be easy to clean.  I haven’t found this to be the case.  After using the rotisserie and the broiler, the edges of the drip pan became encrusted with hard-to-clean material.  I didn't see any advantage to what Miele is offering here. As with other ovens, you cannot leave the grill racks, nor the drip pan, in the oven when using self-cleaning.  Now, that's a feature I would pay for!<br /><br />The heating elements are very close to the front of the oven.  This may help create even heating but I found it a little dangerous…particularly on the lower over.  If you reach your hand in you may touch the heating element: I did…be careful!<br /><br />The ovens have a “dehydrating” feature.  It’s hard to know what that is because it’s not described well in the manual.  Does dehydrating automatically turn off when the item is desiccated?  Is there a recommended time that should be set?  I do know that it does not turn off automatically.<br /><br />The ovens have a surround heating feature.  This is supposed to provide even more uniform cooking than convection cooking.  I found the surround feature to work well.<br /><br />In short, these are adequate high-end ovens that could have used a little more thought and better customer service.  I'm pretty sure they're not worth the premium price but I have not compared them with other high-end expensive ovens.",2014-04-14 17:31:21.000000000,2014,Neutral,Miele : H4890BP2SS 30 MasterChef Double Electric Wall Oven,Appliances,

B015WOKUJ4,2.0,When I opened the brown envelope package I was disappointed at first glance focusing my attention to the hose ...,"Okay I just received this two pack of stainless steel washing machine filler hoses in the extremely fast Amazon delivery fashion . I did not have time to read all the customer reviews but I did base my purchase on the high star rating as I did not want to spend hours or days researching and reading products reviews. When I opened the brown envelope package I was disappointed at first glance focusing my attention to the hose ends. Me, not being a physics major, I do understand the principles of water flow, albeit, gravity, pressurized, pumped or sucked mechanically, hydro or electric. Having said that let me point out that on standard rubber washing machine filler hoses the hose opening is anywhere from 3/8&#34; to half inch generally which allows a speedy fill of the washer tub for washing and rinse cycles. This hose opening is 3/16&#34; which is pretty small to say the least. So people on a municipality water system which pumps water to your house the water delivery pressure is somewhere in the area of 35 to 8o psi max or if pressure is higher than 80 PSI a regulator has to be installed to reduce it under 8o. These hoses most probably work and are okay for the new styles of washing machines that use way less water than the old style machines, using almost quarts of water compared to several gallons of water for the older machines. This small hose opening  under pressure will deliver water similar to when your garden hose nozzle is set to the jet setting, a small fast stream of water under volume and pressure. If any of you have ever witnessed a small pin hole in a copper water  pipe or PEX tubing it spits out a lot of water in a narrow stream. The bottom line is this. These hose will work, but it will just take longer to fill the washer tub. I suspect if I searched longer I would find hoses that are identical to these, being PVC wrapped in stainless steel that have larger openings in the ends. If you are looking to buy new hoses and have the older style and models of washers that use several gallons of water for wash and rinse cycles these are probably not for you, unless you have a lot of idol time or patience. But if you have the newest  models such as the front load or agitator-less styles this hose will work.

B073ZZJ8TB,2.0,"Good for emergency repairs, but don't expect long term operation","After 12 years of being a happy GE fridge owner, the original defrost heater module broke.<br />So I bought the Antoble defrost heater regardless of the negative comments about the smell. It turned out that the initial smell was negligible and after the replacement, the fridge worked great for months. Then today, I noticed the temperature in the fridge was creeping up again. So I removed the cover from the evap coils only to find that the coils were covered in thick ice again (this is an obvious sign of a failure of the defrost heater, thermistor or defrost control board). Since the diagnostic checks confirmed correct thermistor and control board operation, I ended up manually defrosting the coils then testing the heater element. As suspected, the Antoble heater was broke. What I didn't expect is the extreme damage of the gasket between the glass tube and the receptacle. On the GE defrost heater, the gasket was in great shape even after 12 years, on the Antoble, it melted away in 2 months. I give it 2 stars because the heater wire held up for 2 months, but I won't buy from this vendor until they fix the design flaws (gasket and heater wire issues).",2018-08-12 01:49:21.880000114,2018,Negative,"Antoble Refrigerator Defrost Heater for Hotpoint, Kenmore, WR51X10055 GE General Electric RCA Freezer Refrigerators",Appliances,

B0822C3BJ8,1.0,"The jury is still out, but... UPDATE: the jury is out! Pass.","UPDATE<br />I've used this cap twice a day, every day, since I got it. This cap makes one (and only one) improvement over the standard cap--it eliminates leakage while steeping.<br /><br />Here's the kicker...if you are using your Aeropress correctly, leakage is not an issue. Just slightly insert the plunger after adding water, and the naturally-formed vacuum will stop any errant drips. Or, use the inverted method for no drips at all.<br /><br />Mesh filter? Been there, done that. Yes, I prefer paper, but I have a mesh filter, and it works just fine with the standard cap.<br /><br />Oh, and don't even think about using only a paper filter with this cap (that is, without the mesh filter also in place). It will be impossible to press. It's hard enough to press normally!!!<br /><br />Also, the cap is so large, you absolutely cannot use the Aeropress funnel to dispense coffee into a smaller/narrower cup, so forget that.<br /><br />I don't know what real problem this cap solves, and I do not see where it offers any improvement. I've given up using it. I can honestly say I do not like using it and absolutely cannot recommend it.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />I'm not seeing how this is an improvement over the original cap.<br /><br />Here's the thing...the Aeropress was designed to work as constructed. Every time you try to ""improve"" on the design with some gadget, you are likely to be disappointed. Do I follow my own advice? Of course not! That's just the rogue in me, I suppose.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />It seems like this device is solving a problem that doesn't really exist. If you use your Aeropress properly, leakage is minimal. If you use your Aeropress in the inverted fashion, leakage is non existent. Go watch YouTube videos if you're having issues. I guarantee you, someone out there solved the problem and made a video of it.<br /><br />The claim ""...this creates more pressure in order to brew coffee closer to espresso"" is patently false. Is the plunger a lot harder to press? Yes. Does that create the 12-15 bar of pressure necessary to an espresso (or even close)? Not at all. 15 bar is pretty close to 15 ATM (atmospheres) or 220 psi. That's 15 times the pressure of air at sea level, nearly 7 times the pressure in your car tires. You could not possible generate that kind of pressure manually, and certainly not in an Aeropress.<br /><br />Side note: with all of the extra pressing you have to do to get your coffee out, it is ridiculously easy for your cup and the Aeropress to get away from you, making a huge mess, and likely breaking your cup. Be very, very careful to keep everything lined up and apply pressure straight down. If you get off kilter, you will have a disaster.<br /><br />Some people claim this device creates crema. Also untrue. Crema is the off-gassing of carbon dioxide trapped in the beans during roasting. High temperature water (boiling) will cause some off-gassing. The release of high pressure in an espresso machine will create copious quantities of crema. What this device does is mix air in with the coffee, giving you a foam of large air bubbles instead of small carbon dioxide bubbles. Put your coffee in a blender and you get the same effect. Sorry kids, no crema.<br /><br />The stainless steel filter does allow oils to get through, which is good if you like that. It also allows fine particulate matter to get through as well--something a paper filter does not allow. Other steel filters work just as well. In fact, I have a stainless steel filter disc, and the performance is exactly the same. You can use a paper filter instead of the mesh, but I don't think it works as well as using a paper filter with the stock cap.<br /><br />The device is very hard to install, especially on an older Aeropress. I bought mine in 2012--it's still ticking! Getting this thing installed required a lot of effort, though that seemed to improve slightly the more I used it. It will be interesting to note whether the gasket gets deformed.<br /><br />The device does take up more space in your cup, so be prepared to use a larger cup. Or, use the funnel that comes with the Aeropress. Did you ever wonder why the funnel has a hexagonal shape? It's that way for a reason. Fit your Aeropress into the funnel and see for yourself.<br /><br />Clean up is no different than using the stock cap with a stainless steel mesh filter. Just remember to remove the mesh filter before ejecting the puck. (No need to worry about that with paper filters.)<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />Let me start with this...you will never, ever pull an espresso shot (or anything remotely close to it) from an Aeropress. It is simply physically impossible to do so. Anything that claims otherwise is completely untrue.<br /><br />This is probably not better than the stock cap. You can use a mesh filter with a stock cap and get the same results. The ""added pressure"" is nonsense. The ""crema"" is nonsense. For the price you pay, you get a mesh filter (which is around ten bucks anyway) and you get to push a lot harder to get your coffee out. Beyond that, it's a wash.<br /><br />I'm going to keep using it for a while to see if my opinion changes. It cost ten bucks, so it's not like I'm breaking the bank here. If ten bucks is a stretch for you (as it is for a lot of people in these times), save yourself the money and the headache of returning it. Stick with the stock cap and paper filters.",2021-10-28 21:45:37.322999954,2021,Negative,"Airflow Valve Filter for Aeropress Coffee Maker - Trobing Premium Replacement Reusable Stainless Steel Coffee Filters, Dripless Design Brewing Perfect Coffee",Amazon Home,

B002ZNCBRA,5.0,Frigidaire LEQ1442ES1?  Youtube videos are NOT ENOUGH!,"For the money, I rate this product 5 stars as of the first day... this might change if the blue (plastic??) part does not last as long as the original nylon part.  The spindle itself is better than the ones you see on YouTube, because the hub is prethreaded, and the kit DOES include the ball bearing, grease, screws and instructions for ""standard"" machines.  However, if you own one of the newer model Frigidaire dryers, you need more info than the vids offer.  It's not that simple!<br /><br />There is one video on YouTube that does show disassembly for THIS 1442ES dryer properly.  If you've seen it already, you might not need to read all of the stuff below, but the videos always make things seem simple and they edit out their mistakes.  I am just trying to point out that there are dozens of YouTube videos, but they are not for this unit, even though the parts are the same... so watch this one before you begin so you have a good overview at least: [on YouTube, SEARCH ""Frigidaire Dryer Diagnostic - Making a Vibrating Sound When Running""] (This repairman does not really fix anything at all, but at least you get to see the job of removing the panels and the drum).<br /><br />I would also like to say that if your bearing is shot, more than likely the front drum glides and felt are about to need replacing as well, so you might consider purchasing them at the same time and doing the whole job at once.<br /><br />1.  Open the top panel (NOT as shown on YouTube with a putty knife... you will damage the control panel and possibly ruin it).  Instead, just remove the two screws at the top rear of the machine and slide the top BACKWARD and off. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />2.  The bottom panel under the door is removed next so that the upper part can be removed without damage to the blower's foam gasket.  It's held by two screws at the very bottom, and you'll need to tilt the machine back a little to get under there.  Next just pop the panel downward and the pegs pull out from the center panel. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />3.  Now, looking down onto the machine, at the front edge you will see two to four screws that hold the front panel in place.  Mine had only two and the other two holes were not threaded, so the factory skipped them.  You will have the extra chrome screws after installation (new ones furnished) so save those for this purpose. I noticed in the video, there are NO screws in the top... decide for yourself if you want them there.<br />4.  From the top, look down the sides about 8 inches and you will see another screw on each side just above the alignment pegs.  Remove those. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />5.  At the bottom front of the center panel there should be two more screws on little tabs at each side.  Remove those.<br />6.  Remove the little nylon drum catcher from the center of the top... this will make things easier to remove and replace the drum. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />7.  At the top right side of the frame there is a wiring harness.  You will need to cut the zip-tie an squeeze the connectors to disconnect them. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />8.  As you remove the front, support the drum so that it doesn't fall hard on the blower.  Set the panel aside carefully, the top two panels still connected to each other.  It's fine to let the drum rest on top of the blower while you do this.<br />9.  Remove the rear hatch behind the motor and rotate the belt off... it won't be tight because you lowered the drum a little.  I first did this like the videos show, but you can't see what you're doing... better to remove the little rear access panel.<br />10.  Now lift the drum straight up and back gently to lift it off and out of the old bearing... you can look at the new one if you don't understand, it's just a cradle.<br />11.  One of the YouTube videos shows a ""trick"" he says makes changing the bearing easy, by re-using the old bracket, but I actually found it easier (since the top is fully removed from the dryer) to change the whole thing... just put a good dob of grease in the ball bearing socket and it will hold in place.<br />12.  Install the new bearing and bracket as per the written instructions, no problem unless you lose the ball bearing... I guess then it's ok to use the old ball bearing.  Be sure to fill the grooves on the bottom of the plastic bearing with grease.  Use it all and spread a little on the rest of the inside of the plastic.<br />13.  Remove the old spindle ball from the back of the drum and put in the new one.  It's a little bit of a stretch for short-armed guys like me, but I did the first screw by poking the screw through the hole and holding it in place with a long screwdriver.  Snug it slightly to allow the other holes to line up and hand start the other two screws, rotating the drum so you can reach both sides.  If you can't get your arms all the way around it, you might try holding the new spindle in place with tape after lining up the holes. [Not shown in video]<br />14.  Put the drive belt back on the drum and carefully lift it through the opening to near where it was sitting before.  Be careful not to pinch or snarl the belt on something below the drum.<br />15.  Replace the drum and lift it high in the back to put it into the new bearing cradle.  Carefully rotate the drum a little to make sure it seated properly, because you cannot see it at all.<br />16.  Re-install the front panel, being careful to thread the wiring harness back so it does not get pinched.  Re-installation is not as easy as removal, but just hang it from the top brackets and put the screws into the top loosely until you've put in the bottom screws, then replace the side screws and tighten the 8 screws.  Be sure to make sure the drum threads over and around the felt on the front panel opening. [Shown nicely in the above video]<br />17.  Putting the belt back on will be a little tougher with the drum supported, but it does go on.  Make sure you put it around the idler pulley the right way so that the belt is very tight, and the ridged side is making contact with the motor pulley and the drum, backward would probably slip.<br />18.  Snap the wiring harness connectors back together and put in a new tie to hold it away from the rotating drum.<br />19.  Spin the drum with your hands to make sure it is turning freely and not hitting anything... it's easy to fool yourself into thinking you got the spindle into the bearing correctly.  Once you are satisfied all is well, plug in the machine (KEEPING YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM ANY MOVING PARTS OR WIRING) and turn the machine on for a second to see if all is working properly.  If so, turn the machine off and unplug it again until you've replaced the top panel, the small hatch at the back where you access the belt and motor pulley, and lastly the bottom panel at the front, after checking that the blower input duct is snug in place and the foam preventing leaks.<br />20.  Clean up your mess, put the tools away, wipe the grease off the machine and shout ""Honey, it's fixed.""",2014-04-08 22:33:54.000000000,2014,Positive,GENUINE Frigidaire 5303281153 Rear Bearing Kit for Dryer,Appliances,$17.85

B07W6ZT54Z,3.0,Not at fault for making clothes stink like an ashtray.,"My original dryer belt snapped.  It was all chewed up and no part number could be observed.  Kenmore recommended this '341241' part number as the replacement for my model 110.86574100 dryer.  This belt was about 1/4"" wide, whereas the original was more like 3/8"" wide. It is one of two belts that I purchased from Amazon in an attempt to get one that wouldn't stink.  The mismatch in size muddied the waters for understanding what the true problem was with the dryer. [minus 2 stars for not matching original width and confusing the issue] Nonetheless, it was not the root cause of the clothes that kept coming out smelling like an ashtray (seriously it was nasty).  The smell was from the belt, but only because the bearing at the motor (which takes all the side force from the belt tension) was bad, which caused the spindle to heat up and transfer that heat to the belt (causing the belt to outgas).  Both belts (purchased from different sources) looked about the same and lined up with the groves on the spindle perfectly (as observed through an endoscope camera).

B07CTBZMJV,4.0,"Great replacement, prob will need some DIY adjustments","First, it's seems all old fan motors have approximately the same dimensions and the replacements are very similar, with helpful additions to make them ""universal"".  Extra spacers, grommets, and such.<br />All you need to check: will the fan fit in your opening?  check the width of the fan blade against the dimensions of your hole.<br />Second, even tho the products attempt to be universal, they aren't.  In my case, the old fan mounted on the rear wall with slots to attach the back shell of the freezer compartment.  The replacements won't do that.<br />Third, as most everyone else has commented, you need to be a bit handy to make adjustments.  Drill a couple extra holes, using some spare small bolts you have around, etc.<br />The product itself is solid.  It's quiet, relatively well made (I have to say ""relatively"" bec what you do expect for $20), and will do the trick if you're handy.

If the igniter glows bright red you probably have a different problem. If it doesn't glow at all or just barely, this is the bit for you. Make sure you get one with the right connection.

B005BHT1BG,1.0,Cheaply made expensive piece of garbage,"Had this dishwasher for about five years which was 4.5 years too long. I HATE this cheaply-made absolutely inferior pile of garbage. It is abundantly clear the many ways the manufacturer cut corners with crappy fragile plastic parts to maximize profits. Within 6 months the first plastic roller on the top rack disintegrated. Would’ve been $200 to replace the whole rack. I Gerry-rigged a repair and a few months later the other side went. The plastic door for the dishwasher detergent bows and deforms due to the heat so it catches on the edge of its running track half way open. I’ll open the dishwasher to see a waterlogged, bloated dishwasher tab sitting in the bottom of the dishwasher and the dishes are still dirty alone with a coating of dried soap film. Switched to a purely liquid detergent and still no better. The grease trap constantly needs cleaning (weekly or more) and the inside of the dishwasher always has a thick soap film. Typical American manufacturing, charge as much as possible for the lowest quality garbage. If you want any product of any quality, buy German or Japanese manufactured equipment.",2023-03-26 14:43:40.270999908,2023,Negative,"Whirlpool WDT710PAYM Gold 24"" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Appliances,

B009VSD702,1.0,Junk - Threw away after 16 months and 3 repairs,"I purchased mine as part of a set from Lowe's in October 2012.  We had been happy with our Maytag Neptune set for 11 years but our new home required stackable units so we purchased this set.  We were excited b/c of the features and it being a newer and prettier set than our 11 year old Neptunes.  We had them delivered and installed by Lowe's.<br /><br />We were initially happy b/c the sensor functions worked better than our Neptune set and the capacity was slightly better.  The washer worked ok although this dryer does take longer than our old Neptune.<br /><br />We started having issues in June 2013 when we opened the dryer and a 3 inch wide by 6 inch long gash appeared in the drum.  It was very sharp and very dangerous.  It completely shredded a pair of my basketball shorts.  Fortunately, it did not damage other clothes.  The dryer was completely unusable.  This is where the fun began.  We contacted Samsung and could not secure an appointment for TWO WEEKs.  We had already had a service appointment once on the washer (less serious issue but still a warranty issue) that had taken nearly a month to resolve with 4 different trips.  Samsung, the global conglomerate that makes mobile phones, many makes of video monitors / televisions, countless other consumer electronics, hundreds of consumer electronics such as watches-phones-music devices-etc used a sub contractor to work on their appliances that was nearly 4 hours away from our home despite us living within 1 hour of two 800K person cities and 45 minutes from a 250K person city.  They would send a tech from Columbia, SC to Beaufort, SC but not from Charleston, SC or Savannah, GA, or Hilton Head, SC....this led to many long lead times and trips back and forth when the techs could not figure out what to do.  To add insult to injury, there was a 1 month back order on the drum (they had to replace the entire drum to address this).  After 68 days, they finally addressed this with a new drum and we were able to dry clothes again.<br /><br />Now (February 2014), only 17 months later, we have a dryer that shuts off after about 2-3 minutes running.  No matter what setting we use; it just turns off after about 2-3 minutes.  If we stand there long enough re-starting it it may run 10 minutes.  Drying one load can take 5-6 hours and require you to start and re-start over and over.  We contacted Samsung and were told we would wait about two weeks to see a tech, again from Columbia, SC; and we would have to pay for this honor.<br /><br />So long Samsung; your equipment was picked up by our recycling folks in Beaufort.  We have learned our lesson...no more Samsung equipment period.  We even wrote letters to your office of the president and to customer care people who helped us before and got NO RESPONSE after two weeks.  We called both 800 numbers and got nothing but &#34;we are sorry&#34; and run arounds.  So, we bought new electrolux equipment and we will never ever buy Samsung anything again.  Shame on you for building junk and then not supporting it...and finally for not even acknowledging our communications with you.<br /><br />Buyer beware.  I would not buy Samsung unless you buy some type of long term warranty or have the energy and time to do your own work on their equipment.  They clearly do not care enough to support their products in market by having anyone able to respond to emails or letters and dispatching sub contractors from 200 miles away.

B00SBXK3J6,5.0,Open at Back.  Gray Color is Very Attractive,"I purchased two (2) of these Sunbeam Washing Machine Covers.  I purchased the gray color and I purchased one for my washer and one for my dryer.  Both fit perfectly because these cover are ""open"" in the back.  If you can imagine putting on your jacket backwards, that is how these cover fit.  The top, front, and sides are totally, and completely covered (including the raised ""control panel.""  The open back is NOT noticeable at all.  This design is perfect since the washer and dryer I am using them for are still in use, so they are still connected to water hoses, gas lines, exhaust vents, etc.  The sizing is perfect.  I have them covering ""old school"" appliances, a full size washer and full size dryer, both of which have the ""control panel"" on top at the rear of the machines.  These covers are patterned after these type of older appliances.  The gray color is very neutral, a light colored gray.  I originally wanted to buy the beige color since my laundry room (basement) is painted tan and white.  But the price difference between gray and brown was significant, so I purchased the gray and it is perfect since the water heater and furnace all have gray tones.  The material is a little thin but these are just covers, they are not meant to withstand any significant wear and tear.  Again, this is another reason to consider the gray color, which was a lot cheaper than any other color.  These covers are a great purchase.",2019-07-18 14:40:10.503000020,2019,Positive,Sunbeam Washing Machine Cover (Grey),Amazon Home,

B01JHCKJRU,2.0,More Cons that Pros,"I purchased this washer a year ago (not at Amazon, but posting a review so others can learn some of my issues before making a purchasing decision).<br /><br />The Good:<br />(1) It's quiet.<br />(2) It doesn't take a walk across the laundry room when spinning, as my old machine did.<br />(3) It has an agitator, which cleans clothes well. (Old washer did NOT clean clothes).<br /><br />The Bad:<br />(1) The ONLY setting that allows water to fill to completely cover clothes is the ""Heavy"" setting.<br />(2) Lid lock. What's the point?<br />(3) While it cleans clothes very well, it also destroys them. I had eight towels shredded, new bed sheets get holes in them, and a few nice blouses ripped beyond repair. And that was just in the first month of owning this washer.<br />(4) It eats clothes. So many, in fact, that I've named this machine ""Jaws."" I have lost six pair of underwear, four socks, two bathrobe belts and a few hair ties that are now underneath the agitator. You cannot get that agitator off to remove/retrieve the eaten items. There is a lug nut waaaay down at the bottom of the agitator that can only be reached with a socket wrench extension (which I purchased but, alas, the freakin' screw was on too tight). Called a repairman, who told me that the agitator cannot be removed. (Huh?! WTF?!) Told me I would just have to leave the ""eaten"" clothing under the agitator. (Great. Now mold can develop!)<br />(5) Be prepared to see your gas or electricity bill (depending upon what type of dryer you have) DOUBLE with this washing machine. Clothes come out sopping wet. I have to dry most clothes TWICE and some loads (like towels and bedsheets) THREE times to get them dry.<br /><br />This washer's price may be cheap, but you'll spend far more replacing ripped and lost clothing items--as well as increased costs from multiple drying cycles--than what you'll save with the lower initial machine price.<br /><br />My advice: Take a pass.",2022-11-22 02:05:06.542999983,2022,Negative,Amana NTW4516FW 3.5 Cu.

B01N7RHMKZ,4.0,The drum may not spin out of the box. EASY FIX,The common issue with this dryer is that the drum will not spin right out of the box. The solution is to take off the back cover and reset the black belt on the drum just like a bike chain on the gears. It’s annoying that one should have to do this but any person who is semi handy and has a screwdriver can do it. I live on a 3rd floor apartment that I’m not planning on staying in for more than a year so a full size dryer was not an option. I have paired this with a giantex washer and it has served my 3 roommates an I without fail for 6 months 3 loads a day 4-5 times a week.

B00G9EHGDK,4.0,Use wash bags to avoid damage to your clothes,"Since we don't have hookups and our home is small, this is our next best option.  I'd rather have a full size machine since this one requires your attention to move to each step, but it's doable until we get hookups installed.  It cleans really well, and it can do really small loads, which I like.  The agitator is incredibly strong though, and will easily damage clothes if they are not placed in a wash bag, which reduces the usefulness of the machine somewhat.  Fortunately, I'm mostly using it to wash cloth diaper prefolds which can take a beating.<br /><br />If you use wash bags, get ones that keep the zipper from opening in the wash, otherwise they WILL open.  Also be sure to get bags with good stitching as this machine has ripped the zippers out of several of my wash bags.<br /><br />Mine arrived missing a small piece (the lid that goes inside the spinner), but customer service was very responsive and sent me a replacement quickly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Forgot to add, it does the equivalent of about a 1/3 load in a regular machine.  And it does little for lint.  We ended up getting a dryer partly because line drying takes too long when you have an infant to take care of, and it removes most of the lint.",2015-03-27 23:52:25.000000000,2015,Positive,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine Pan30 Drain By Gravity,Appliances,

We have a whole house filter and an under the sink filter that is both hooked up to the fridge. It just doesn't taste the same. No bad, but we liked the soft taste of LG original filter... kinda like Evian. Will not buy again.

B00DM8JA7Q,5.0,worked on my Kenmore Series 70 model 110.20712 991,The other day i was washing a load of laundry and right before it was ready to drain the water i noticed my machine seem to quit working. So i messed around with it awhile and come to find out everything worked expect it would not drain nor would the spin cycle work. So i had the fun job of scooping all the water out by hand. I then did some research and found out that the lid switch was one of the common things to cause this issue i was having. So i borrowed a multimeter tester from my dad and then i pulled my washer apart and found the switch and unhooked it to test it and from what i could tell was it was shot. When i decided that was the issue i came to my favorite place to look for a replacement and it was here on amazon. I was surprised i could find it for about 8-10 dollar including any shipping charges. However i decided to buy one from a seller that offered 2 day prime shipping and paid about 30 dollars for 1 day shipping instead. I know i overpaid and it was worth the extra 20 dollars to get it in a day. I just did not want to wait a week or so to fix the issue. I also looked around to make sure this would work with my exact washer and found that sears was selling the same one for 45 dollars on their website so in the end i still saved some money. If you need to replace the switch save money and do it yourself. It is so easy to find videos online to teach you and after you do it once it will be that much easier the next time. I would say it would take about 20-30 minutes to replace it yourself. It took me less that 10 because i already had the washing machine apart and i pretty much knew what to do before hand so i wasn't fighting with it today when i switched it for the new one. Overall i am happy and i was happy to get a load of clothes washed. I am really happy and was happy to find it here on amazon.,2016-07-14 22:25:51.000000000,2016,Positive,Whirlpool 3949238 Washer Lid Switch,Tools & Home Improvement,$35.15

B004H3XPQW,5.0,Easy Fix to Cure Oven Which Won't Light Up Broiler,"This worked Perfect to replace a bad Igniter.  My old one would light up red hot, but not draw enough amps/current to turn open the gas valve.  It looked like it was working fine too, that's the problem.  It glowed red hot. But the gas valve would not open.  The old Igniter was Weak. So this New Igniter solved the problem for a very low price.  It is not too hard to install.  You may need to use the wire nuts which are included with this new igniter.  The attachment screws (to the burner bar) came out/went back in okay, but you will need to pull out your oven to connect the wires up in back.  You Do Not need to Solder the wires, as you tighten high temp wire nuts on them or use the connector if it matches up.  You need to pull racks out and the bottom oven pan and possibly pull off the whole oven door, that's about it.  Will take about an hour, including pulling oven out, attaching wires, attaching unit to burner bar, etc.  Be sure the wire nuts are tight and be sure the Insulated wires don't rub against the stove metal cutout in the back of the oven.  I put electrical tape on that area, so the wires would touch that tape and not metal over time.",2018-03-07 21:42:58.523000001,2018,Positive,GE WB13K21 Igniter for Oven,Appliances,$27.13

B003ZE5NPK,4.0,"And on the third day, the refrigerator was alive!","On Wednesday, the refrigerator let the family down.  Less than 9 years old and the Whirlpoool Gold model GI5FSAXVY03 gave up the ghost.  On that very same day, the Independence day appliance sales were ending.  So what is a family of 4 to do?  We ordered a new, but on back order refrigerator.  So starts the race!  Can I fix it before the new fridge ships?  Trusty Amazon has the correct part at half the cost of the OEM site and delivers 42 hours later.  5 minutes after the part hits the porch, the reefer is humming along.  Hooray for the service!!!  We ""saved"" $2800.  For the technical folks out there:<br />- The refrigerator would not cool, no compressor action or noise<br />- The interior lights would come on when the door opened<br />- The front water dispenser/ice maker would emit a ""beeeeeeeeep"" for as long as the lever to dispense was pushed<br />- Any front panel button push on the dispenser would perform what was essentially a ""light check"" on the front dispenser where every light and LED segment would light up<br />- When unplugged and plugged back in, the only thing that would happen is the water/ice dispenser would make a noise like the ice chute was being closed.  Nothing else.<br />So, we bought the HV control module, part number W10310240.  Swap was a piece of cake.  Once the new panel was installed, I just had to google ""programming Whirlpool refrigerator"" and follow the directions to enter the correct program code.  The programming instructions should have shipped with the HV control board, but they did not.  The review would have been 5 stars if the programming instructions were included.<br />I hope this review guides you to a good outcome if you are ever in the same situation!",2019-07-13 19:38:15.411000013,2019,Positive,"Whirlpool W10310240 Control Board, HV",Tools & Home Improvement,$289.05

B00JV8GLAK,1.0,Samsung products need to be discontinued.,"Quick update to this: I did get the oven control panel repaired after a lovely woman at Lowe's contacted Samsung for me to prove it was in warranty. However now a little over a year later, the oven doesn't ignite. If you search for ""Samsung oven doesn't heat"", there are 18 pages on the Samsung forums of customers with 1 to 2 year old Samsung ovens that don't ignite.<br /><br />Original review:  This doesn't even deserve 1 star. As every other negative review states, it works great for a couple of months, then breaks. I bought this last August. Control panel buttons stopped working in May. After fighting with Samsung to get it repaired under the 1-year warranty, the buttons have stopped working again. Samsung claims I'm not in warranty. According to the representative I spoke to, the receipt I uploaded when I registered the product last August doesn't transfer to the service department so I need to upload the receipt again. Lowe's prints their receipts on tissue thin paper that is no longer legible so Samsung won't accept it. Since my Samsung refrigerator has also been repaired four times in three years (which I didn't actually buy but Best Buy lost my LG refrigerator and gave me the Samsung instead - long story), I not only refuse to buy any Samsung product ever again, I now make sure to warn anyone considering their products.",2018-07-27 23:21:15.868000031,2018,Negative,"Samsung NX58H5600SS 30 In.

Eventually, the fridge box gets warmer and warmer, unable to exchange the heat over the freezer coils. The little unit was easy to access under a cover in the top of the fridge.

There was no way to get the hair out because it was inside of the air gap on the front and had obviously made its way inside there during the molding process.  The only way to see it was with the contrast of the white ice in the tray.

It should open fully to dispense ice and then snap shut about 2 seconds after releasing the lever. If the door never opens or stays open, a faulty solenoid is most likely the culprit.<br />I was able to remove and replace this item with a Phillips head screwdriver in less than 10 minutes.<br />Watch a couple of YouTube videos for helpful tips for installing.<br /><br />Worth every penny to have my ice on demand working like new!",2021-09-26 00:46:38.742000103,2021,Positive,ERP WR62X10055 Refrigerator Solenoid Assembly,Appliances,$21.95

B000UWGLGU,5.0,Haier HLP140E Dryer,"I have had a ""SpaceMaker"" washer/dryer combination where the washer just gave out one day after 15 years of use. I decided then and there I would not buy a single combination unit again and went for separate washer and dryer, that way you replace one part and not the whole unit. I bought this dryer as it fit my need and was within my price range.<br /><br />I have had the unit for a month and think the dryer is very good. People complain about the small amount of clothes you can dry but after having the SpaceMaker I am used to doing more smaller loads. I have also been combining this dryer with a drying rack. I take the wet clothes out of the washer, let them air dry for up to 8 hours then put them in the dryer. This process has greatly reduced the time I need to use the dryer and what I have done in the past with my SpaceMaker unit. So far, so good. I have no complaints. I also don't think it is that loud compared to my old dryer, even though Haier dryer has a slight larger capacity than the SpaceMaker. I am single and can fit all my clothes in the dryer, including a Queen size sheet, without problems. For towels I only put two at a time, but I pre-dry them as it saves time and energy.<br /><br />I have also decided not to mount it on the wall. It weighs about 50 lbs but I am afraid it could come crashing down on my washer. Maybe some others are brave but not me. I don't trust my walls to hold it. I am using a simple cart that I bought on Amazon.com that fits the bill.<br /><br />All in all I replaced a SpaceMaker unit with a washer, dryer and cart for less money so I can't complain.",2012-01-11 12:56:25.000000000,2012,Positive,Haier HLP140E 2-3/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Tumble Vented Dryer,Appliances,

The refrigerator looks nice but always seemed to make a lot of noise and sounded noisy then lower models I have owned even while being a renter.  After 3 1/2 years, everything started happening.  First the compressor and cooling line needed to be replaced, luckily that was under full warranty.  Then 6 months after that, the main computer board that regulates the refrigerator's temperatures went bad, and that was not under warranty!  Several hundreds of $$ later, issue resolved.  Then six months later, guess what?  Leak in the cooling line and compressor started going bad again.  Parts for this repair would have been covered under manufacturer warranty, but labor was not so the estimated repair was around $700.  At this point I am going to get a new refrigerator, not a Kitchen Aid this time just in case.<br /><br />AS FYI, alll three times the refrigerator had problems, the symptoms were always the same.  The freezer temperature would increase to 8, 9, 10 up to 14 degrees, then go back to 0 only to happen again numerous times throughout the day/week.

One of the nuts fell off so I had to turn on its side to put it back on and realized it is the belt that works the spinner that is giving off small specks of rubber. I will have to order another belt just in case I need it for the future.,2020-09-12 20:27:16.668999910,2020,Positive,"Portable Washing Machine, Kuppet 10lbs Compact Mini Washer, Wash&Spin Twin Tub Durable Design to Wash All your Laundry or Swim Suit for Apartments, Dorms, RV Camping (Blue)",Tools & Home Improvement,
B089Y2RC7N,5.0,Love this thing!,"It definitely uses less water then washing dishes by hand! Except for it not being big enough for the bigger pots and pans, which is fine with me. I just use 3 jugs of the container that comes with the dishwasher to fill the tank, I fill the square inside the door up to the top with powder detergent, and let it work. Very good at getting out messes! It dries well, but for certain dishes, you'll need to run the dry cycle a second time to get them completely dry.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that I received mine with the glass door panel being shattered. I called Amazon and they gave me a full refund. Luckily it still works!<br /><br />Love this dishwasher!

B06VW9HKXF,5.0,The product fit my Samsung,I had to wait till I used one before I could write this review. I would recommend that one keeps either a new or used filter to compare with what is ordered. I read several reviews that stated that the filter did not fit. What I received was as advertised and the same brand I ordered in the past. I was waiting the 6 months before my replacement light came on. The product was easy to install but I used a pair of vice grips to turn the used filter to the left to remove it because it has been in the Samsung for just over the 6 month mark. It might have to be changed sooner if more people were drinking the water. This is a great replacement and at a lower cost because of the 3 pack and lower than Samsung.,2020-09-22 16:35:08.461999893,2020,Positive,"GOLDEN ICEPURE DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, Replacement for Samsung Water Filter HAF-CIN/EXP RF28HFEDBSR, RF263BEAESR, RF4287HARS,RF4267HARS,DA97-08006A 3PACK",Appliances,$26.99

Wish the residual water could be purged from the used filter to avoid the heavy weight and dripping that occurs. Next time I will reuse the end tips from the new filter and recap the old filter. Leaving the old filter to drain doesn't work. 3 star rating due to life of product. My previous refrigerator filter lasted a year and was more environmentally friendly.

My washer sits on a stand and the putting the pads on was a major hassle without getting my washer to tip one way or another. This is definitely a two person job. Once I did have the pads on I tested it out and ended up deciding to remove them. Since my washer sits on a stand I would have to remove the stand or have the possibility that this would tip over.

I bought this adapter. It does not work properly in my case. Here is why.<br /><br />After the 1996 code change, appliances were sold with the case ground separated from neutral. This configuration requires a 4-conductor power cord with a separate ground wire that connects street ground (from your junction box) to the ground screw on the appliance.<br /><br />The NEC still allows the use of existing 3-prong receptacles, if you are replacing a range and have a 3-slot receptacle present. However, you must connect the ground screw on the appliance (the chassis ground) to the neutral terminal.<br /><br />This adapter does not connect the chassis ground to neutral. If I use the adapter, my stove will work, but the adapter does not make the connection properly. What I did instead was to add a grounding strap from the appliance's ground screw to the appliance's neutral connection and then use a 3-prong cable.<br /><br />Please look at the accompanying figure for details.",2022-03-21 22:26:29.825999975,2022,Negative,10-50P MALE 3-PIN PLUG to 14-50R 4-PIN FEMALE RECEPTACLE STOVE RANGE OVEN POWER CORD ADAPTER 250V NEMA FX355,Tools & Home Improvement,$59.95

B01AGQ4MH4,4.0,Nice washer/ very small basket,"[[VIDEOID:50e9fed0612155b6670e1ea28121a3c]] I really like this little washer. It’s a great size for my bathroom counter top to make draining the water out easy. It washes a good amount of clothes per wash. Clothes get pretty clean as well. You can see all the dirty and junk in the water as it drains. I use a bucket to fill the tub it’s faster then the little hose attached. I’ve been washing the clothes for about 3-5 min and rinse for about 3. This method has been working well for me. I’ve done about 6 Loads now. The only complaint I have is the spin cycle. It’s a joke. If your plus size and have larger/heaver clothing only one article at a time will fit and sometimes just barely. My bf is a larger man with big, thick work pants. I really have to squeeze them down in the little basket and the unit shakes so bad due to the weight no matter how I load the basket. This has been happening with not just heavy items as well. Most times I have to hold the unit down while it spins or the unit will dance around my counter. Besides that it’s a good buy. You can definitely get away with hand wringing it out or can hold down the unit while it spin drys. Definitely beats the hassle of doing my laundry in the apartment complex. 3rd floor lugging of clothes plus the machines don’t work most the time. This has been a convience.

B076J241YS,3.0,Bad Compressors and Poor Phone Support,"My LG refrigerator is less than 2 years old.  The compressor failed on October 30.  When I called LG, I was told that there was only a 1-year warrantee, so the repair would be at my expense. She told me to open and close the freezer doors, but this didn’t work.<br />I decided to contact a local service repairman and after he looked at the fridge (and a $75 fee), he told me the compressor was bad and that he was seeing a lot of these bad compressors on LG refrigerators.  The product looks nice and has some great features, but it does me no good if they install bad compressors.  After some research, we found that there is a class action lawsuit for this problem before 2018.  Shame on LG for continuing to sell cheap, unreliable products.<br />After more research on my own, I found out that these compressors have a 5-year warrantee, so I had new hope.  Too bad LG did not volunteer this information on the phone.<br />So I decided to call LG directly once again.  On November 10, I called LG to inform them about the diagnosis of a compressor problem.  The man I spoke to in service was incompetent and unable to speak in an understandable manner. He assured me that I had an appointment on November 12 between 8-12 AM.  So I stayed home that day waiting for the repair visit.<br />At noon that day there was no phone call and no visit.  So I called LG once again to report this issue.  The lady who handled the call said she had no record of the appointment.  Also, she had no record of my problem, no model number, no address, etc. This was my third time talking to LG!  She proceeded to reschedule the appointment, but there was another delay of 5 days.  She mentioned it would be fixed free of charge for my inconvenience.<br />On Monday, November 16, I was contacted by LG the day before my new assigned appointment. This was much appreciated!  And on November 17 a competent repairman changed out my compressor.  So after 2 ½ weeks I finally had a working refrigerator.<br />In the end it only cost me $75 for an initial diagnosis. However, the phone help line at LG is very poor and this weakness should be corrected by the company.",2020-11-24 21:19:42.936000109,2020,Neutral,LG LMXS28626S 28 cu.ft. 4-Door French Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel,Appliances,$1799.00

B005NK21MM,5.0,"City living, now with the luxuries of the suburbs","I'm your average 30 year old living in NYC in a modest sized apartment, of course, with no dishwasher and no ability to install one based on my lease contract. My roomate and I had a dishwasher in our old apartment and have really been terrible about doing the dishes, but since neither of us like looking at a sink full of dirty cups, I took matters into my own hands and bought this baby. So far I've had it about a week and here are my initial thoughts:<br /><br />1. This is perfect for your normal city dweller running mugs/cups/utensils from food delivery and maybe a plate or two. If you have a big family or a lot of dishes it'll still get the job done, but its not really tailor made for that.<br />2. I've been using those Cascade three-in-one dishwasher tablets and they work really well, all the dishes come out clean and sparkly just like at my parent's house!<br />3. It was super easy to set up, although it is a big large on my countertop. However, its a price I'm willing to pay for having a dishwasher and it is nice looking alongside my stainless steel appliances. Not exactly stainless steel itself, but close enough.<br />4. Its rather quiet and doesn't move around or anything.<br /><br />Once or twice I've gotten an E1 error part was through doing the wash, which it seems like just meant I didn't have my water turned on high enough. Since making that change it has completed each was perfectly (I've done about one a day just because its so exciting, I can't use up my cups fast enough!)<br /><br />I will update if I have any issues, and for the first time ever I bought the 3 year warantee because there was no way I was going to try and mail this beast somewhere if something happened. I hope I won't need it since the quality really is quite good, but for $30 its worth the peace of mind, even though its usually a sucker move.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a little dishwasher to make your urban life feel more suburban, this little guy really does the trick!",2014-01-27 15:07:29.000000000,2014,Positive,"ANTOGOO 262c6e 6de92c, full size, White",Amazon Home,

Even though I have a Maytag this Whirlpool part is made for several models. Here is the different part numbers this Heating Element is knows as: W10310274 (AP4567080) replaces 74010883, 1863288, AH3407743, EA3407743, PS3407743. Whirlpool brands include Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air, Amana, Magic Chef, Admiral, Norge, Roper, and others.<br />Before you start make sure you shut off the power to the Stove/Oven from the Service (Breaker) Panel - just flip the switch to “off”. You'll need a Philips screwdriver to remove the 2 each screws on the back oven wall. Once the screws are removed slowly pull the heating element out from the wall to disconnect the 2 wire connections.<br />Note: The hardest part of this whole task is getting the old element out from the backside of the oven without the electric terminals coming loose and stuck behind the oven wall. If that happens you’ll have to remove the stove back panel to get to this area, which means you’ll have to remove the stove away from the kitchen wall to get to it. A big pain!<br />I find moving the heating element side to side will allow the interior wall insulation to unwrap itself from the terminal leads at the tips of the elements. If everything goes right you should have about 3 or 4 inches of wire exposed though the cavity. Now just disconnect the electrical lead on each end of the heating element and swap them out to the new heating element. Reinstall the 2 screws and wipe off the new heating element with a damp towel to remove fingers prints, debris, etc. Oils from your hands could cause a “hot” spot and burn the new element at that area. Now turn the Breaker back on and turn the oven to bake. Wait 3 - 5 seconds and you should sense heat.

B005AR75A6,5.0,"Easy to install, perfect replacement, hope it's more durable than the original (fit a Maytag)","Although this is a Whirpool-branded part, it perfectly fit my Maytag model MDB7600AWS. This was a perfect replacement and online videos helped prepare me for the easy, quick installation.  A few pointers on that:  TURN OFF THE ELECTRICAL POWER TO THE DISHWASHER (at the fuse or breaker box) BEFORE THE INSTALLATION, since this job puts you directly in contact with electrical parts inside. It is easy to crack or strip delicate plastic parts by overtightening the screws during installation, so I recommend you avoid using an electric screwdriver for this job.  I needed a Torx T20 hand screwdriver, and needle nose pliers (used to gently pry the wiring harness connector away from the metal electrical contacts on the latch assembly).  There were two different types of screws holding the inside of my washing machine door: shorter sheet metal screws (with pointy tips), and longer machine screws (with a flat leading tip). The longer screws are for the ""top"" row--the part of the inside of the dishwasher door that the latch sits under. Those longer screws connect to molded plastic threads inside the door, so BE VERY CAREFUL TO AVOID OVERTIGHTENING, so you do not strip the fragile plastic threads, or even crack the plastic door parts.  The shorter sheet metal screws fit along the sides of the inside of the dishwasher door. Those connect into metal, but you still need to avoid overtightening those, to prevent cracking the inside of the dishwasher door.",2021-08-26 20:24:28.937000036,2021,Positive,"Whirlpool W10130695 Latch Assembly for Dishwasher, Black",Tools & Home Improvement,$19.95

B00DM8JA5S,4.0,Removal problems associated with dryer motor,"Once installed, this motor works just fine. Unfortunately, removal of the old motor was not as simple as the online video would suggest. The key is the separation of the blower fan from the rear of the motor. The fan is made from resin or plastic and has a raised square journal surrounding the threaded hole that allows the fan to thread onto the rear of the motor shaft. Using an appropriate size wrench, hold the square journal on the fan to prevent it from turning while using another wrench to turn the pulley retaining nut on the front of the shaft. As you turn the motor shaft, the fan is suppose to unthread from the motor shaft, The fan end of the shaft is left-handed thread so that the fan tends to remain tightly fixed to the shaft during operation.<br />Unfortunately, due to the type of material the fan is made from, when drying multiple loads of laundry, the fan becomes pliable and can actually get tighter on the shaft. When the unit cools, you'll find that the fan has become frozen to the shaft. Attempting to apply excessive force to rotate the shaft only serves to round-off the square journal on the fan making it impossible to remove. This happened to me causing me to have to remove the back of the machine, the blower duct & use a saws-all to cut the motor shaft so the motor could be removed. Truly a nuisance and a lot more work.<br />This, of course, is not the fault of the motor since the blower fan is not a part of the motor and when you order a new motor, you do not receive a new fan with it. The fan, if required, must be ordered separately. I believe this is the dryer manufacturer's design flaw. If the blower fan were made of aluminum or some other light-weight metal, rounding off the square journal would be far less likely.",2014-06-17 15:06:22.000000000,2014,Positive,"Whirlpool 279827 Dryer Drive Motor, White",Tools & Home Improvement,$70.52

Installing the new gears was a chore - not the fault of the kit but the fault of a 30+ year old compactor that had never been serviced.  Getting the big gear off was fairly easy, but I did it in an unconventional way - instead of loosening the motor I loosened one of the corner gears.<br /><br />Getting the shaft gear off was pure hell, I finally had to heat the shaft and then the pin could be hammered out using a pin-punch.  Putting the new gear on was straight-forward as I could apply some grease first.<br /><br />Then I started sorting through all the other parts in the kit and discovered they do not fit inside my weird compactor, but then again nothing was malfunctioning other than the broken gear so I didn't care.  So the parts for the two rods that pull the compactor top down were not used.<br /><br />I used this opportunity to thoroughly clean the chain and screw rods, and put heavy duty grease back on them - hopefully I will get years of additional service for the old compactor.  I checked the compactor to make sure it was not compressing too hard - this breaks the gear I had to replace.  If you have your original manuals then you will find a section that describes how to set the compaction pressure correctly.  Too little and you use more bags, too much and you start damaging the compactor components.",2020-08-23 17:50:10.997999907,2020,Positive,"Whirlpool 882699 Drive Gear Kit for Trash Compactor, White",Tools & Home Improvement,

B004XLDIR4,4.0,works well but slightly bad design by whirlpool....,"So my washer is a whirlpool GHW9200LW, and 2 out of 3 of these baffles were missing. Don’t know how it got that way - washer came used with a house. Without the baffles, the clothes get torn up. There are sharp metal clip/latches built into the drum. The baffles latch into the drum clips pretty tightly. But obviously not tight enough - if they fell off! Anyway, the first trick is to clip the baffles in carefully testing the alignment to make sure all clips have engaged. The next step involves a bit of tricky repair work: 1) take off the washer top. 2) Locate a small corrugated rubber water feed around the 11 o'clock position. 3) Carefully wiggle this loose - don't break it! Use your fingers - not a screwdriver. 4) With the water tube off the drum exterior can, you will see the stainless steel can inside. you are actually looking at the outside of the stainless steel can. Rotate the drum until you see the screw hole for the baffles. NOTE: you might want to locate this hole before actually installing the baffles. 5) Using a magnetic screwdriver, mount the screw, and then carefully start seating into the baffle through the water tube hole! Using this method avoids a boat-load of repair work. Without this trick, it’s probably not worth trying to install new baffles. Anyway, the whirlpool company should have design these baffles with a better screw/locking mechanism so they don't actually fall out! The washer is pretty nice though.

The problem is the catch basket is full in about an hour and the machine will stop making ice at that point.  Then if you don't empty it of ice the ice will melt and you have nothing left.  If you keep up on emptying the tray and refilling with water it will make a 10 lb bag of like you buy at the store in a day, but it's a lot of work getting there.

B07H3NX5CG,5.0,"If your Samsung filter stopped fitting, **THIS** is the DA29-00003G replacement that actually works!","There are apparently many people who are in the same boat of having Samsung's supposed ""DA29-00003G"" model filter suddenly stop fitting in their refrigerator. My fridge has always used that Samsung filter, and I had reordered the same exact item 4 times from Amazon...until it suddenly was impossible to screw in. The reason is because the plastic tabs at the top of the current iteration of the ""Samsung DA29-00003G"" filter are configured differently than the old one. Why they would call it the same part number is beyond me...<br /><br />So I tried looking in a bunch of listings on here for tabs that seemed similar to my *previous* iteration of DA29-00003G filter...and for some reason most of the 3rd party (i.e. Chinese) filters don't clearly show the tab configuration. I tried a different brand that did not work, before finally arriving at this ""ICEPURE"" filter -- and it fits great!<br /><br />The taste is frankly indiscernible from my prior Samsung ones -- though I understand from reading other reviews from more knowledgable people when I was researching a replacement that this ICEPURE filter does not filter out some types of contaminants that the Samsung one does. For me, since I am in a major metropolitan city, that was not of particular concern to me since I have to assume that the water treatment is pretty top-notch at the municipal level.

B00DM8JXJ6,5.0,Absolutely perfect fit. Exact replacement for original in my Kenmore ...,"Absolutely perfect fit.  Exact replacement for original in my Kenmore dryer.  Some advice.... consider buying the blower wheel as well or else try to remove the blower wheel (which you have to do in order to remove the old motor) before ording the motor so that if you end up needing the wheel you can order it along with the motor.  I say this because the plastic blower wheel's square hole, into which you're supposed to insert a 1/2&#34; drive in order to remove the wheel, stripped.  I've read some other reviews on other sites where this happened to other people.  I suppose if you have Amazon Prime you can just get the motor and if you end up needing the wheel you can get one delivered in two days like I did.  The only way I could get the wheel off was to chisel it apart with a screwdriver and hammer unfortunately.  Overall though, a very easy removal and installation process and the motor works great.  Very quiet, like a new dryer.  Saved about $60 vs. buying it at SearsPartsDirect.com not to mention it beats paying several $ hundred on a new dryer.

B00DM8K1NS,5.0,OEM Replacement Ice Maker for my Whirl Pool Conquest Side by Side item 2198597,"My original ice maker stopped making ice.  I performed the normal checks like first off checking to see if water (water valves also) was being delivered, and the additional checks for sensors functioning, power, motor working, etc.  I diagnosed a few parts that may have been the culprit, but buying parts individually would cost much more.  I also checked none OEM replacements at a lesser cost that probably would have worked fine.  However, I decided to pay the extra money for the OEM ice maker, and I am very happy with my decision.  The unit was an exact match and the performance did not disappoint.  I expect it to last for years to come and if needed could probably use parts from the old OEM unit.  Also, I selected standard shipping but the seller shipped this product very quickly; humorously they must have had sympathy that I needed ice immediately.  I would recommend this product to others.<br /><br />(my standard note: When I rate a product I impart as much clarity and actual personal experience of the product as possible to hopefully assist others.  I do not use or allude to for the money; and more than likely neither will the manufacturer if they expect to sell a product.  If I pay $15 for a product selling in the market versus $500 for an original; I expect the same performance regardless of price savings.  Making and selling a product at a lower costs does not equate to cheap.  Less cost should only mean that a competitor has learned to do the same or better at a lower cost.)",2014-04-07 03:01:26.000000000,2014,Positive,"Whirlpool 2198597 Icemaker, White",Appliances,

The wire connections are angled slightly differently, but this made no difference in useability in my stove after a minor adjustment to the arrangement. It works as well as the original, but this one was significantly less expensive the standard replacement.<br /><br />Replacing these surface elements is surprisingly simple. BE SURE TO UNPLUG YOUR STOVE, OR TURN OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER FIRST, because some of the wires on the element have power all the time, as I was surprised to find out. Just remove two screws on the front of the oven, and lift the stovetop like the hood of a car, and prop it open with a stick of some kind. Look closely at style of wire connections you have, in order to make sure that you buy the least expensive element that will fit the size of your wire terminals. I had to re-arrange a few screws to make this element line up with my mounting clips, because it wasn't the factory original part that I could have bought for my stove. After about 5 minutes work with a screwdriver to move the mounting clips (the new element came with the screw holes already drilled in it), this element snapped right in place just like the original, for about half the price, and no service charge or appointment.",2015-02-28 19:41:27.000000000,2015,Positive,"Electrolux FRICGLEF379DBE Element,Dual,9/6,Surface,120",Tools & Home Improvement,

There is a green spring included if needed for your application. The instructions say to refer to the chart (really just four line drawings) of different washer types and a description. It also tells you which spring to use for each of these unit types: the blue one, or the black one. Yes, it says blue or black, even though it comes with a blue and green (there is no black spring option).<br /><br />UPDATED 2021:  Lasted until Feb 2021. I just had to replace this with a new one. Nowhere near the duration of the original, but I'm glad that this washer can still be repaired so easily! (and relatively inexpensively).

B0097C43BO,4.0,"Works well, easy to install, not 100% reliable, alerts are too slow for anything important","Installed the base station and three sensors in a house.  Installation and registration was easy, just need to do it in the right order.  Installed the app for iPhone and that worked off the same account from registration.  The sensors work well but lose connection roughly once a week.  Signal strength is above 90% according to the app but sensors will not report for hours.  Sensors are between 15 to 30ft away and on different floors, but no correlation to the failures.<br /><br />The alerts are slow, I'll get a text alert at 8:30am for an event that happened at 6:30am according to the text.  Charts in the app and online work but the x-axis is a pretty useless serious of random timestamps for a chart that spans 4-5 days.  Touching the charts will highlight datapoints with temp and time, but no date.  No ability to zoom or scroll through time.  You can download a CSV file of the data via the website, but when I tried to download the file it occasionally gave me an empty CSV file with just a single row of headers.

I tried looking for similar hoses at the hardware store near me but low and behold the fittings for the hoses that come with the product are custom made so that you can’t add an additional hose to the machine.

In all fairness though I had a grate that was broken and the seller took care of it immediately but they could not help on a technical question.

B001EY53MG,5.0,Totally legit and saved my coworkers from my unwashed fragrance,"My 1.5 year old $1400 samsung washer stopped working completely. I ripped the thing apart and learned just about everything about washers. They're stupidly simple. Every route with my e05 (I believe) error lead me to believe a hose was clogged. Pulled out every single hose and ran water through them, no issues. Finally somewhere I found that I need to grab a voltmeter and test the continuity of the connections of each valve/solenoid (idk whatever) and my cold water valve was just dead. The one next to it and my hot were fine, but my cold was reporting 0. Ordered this and had it one day shipped and I was up and running the next day. Seriously had low expectations but yall saved my hide. I had just gotten home from a 2 week camping/hiking trip and ran out of clothes to wear. Also side by side this looks exactly like my original Samsung valve. It must be the same manufacturer.<br /><br />edit; Sorry, I should mention, my issue was that my washer would &#34;run&#34; for about 3 minutes but not fill with water then give me the E05 error. Basically a &#34;washer cant fill with water&#34; error. And installing this was literally 2 (maybe 4) screws on the back of the washer, then you unplug two electric plugs. It was stupidly simple.

She flat out told us she didn't care to do this, even though Whirlpool has had numerous complaints about this long-standing issue. Nor will she pass on the information to manufacturing or someone who can do something about the product.

B01794EUQY,5.0,Wonderful coffee without all the waste,"My husband and I use our Keurig coffee maker at least ten to fifteen times a day.

My husband and I tend to like really dark strong coffee and it is very hard to get that using regular Keurig coffee pots. However with these reusable ones I can pack as much of the dark roast coffee that I like in it and get the perfect cup of coffee. They are so easy to clean up you just tap them in the trash everything comes out cleanly and then you just rinse it off. Also love the fact knowing that I'm not wasting all that money and I'm not wasting all that plastic and container material that is produced with the K-Cup packs. And there's two of them so you don't have to wait for one to cool down before you can use the other one, just go right ahead on with the second one. They are very well constructed and I think we will be using these for a long time to come. It came with very clear instructions packaging was excellent you could tell that the seller took care and how they package the product so that it reached you in perfect condition, which it did.

I put fresh eggs into these containers and they fit beautifully.  Our girls lay very large eggs and these containers have no problem handling the eggs and still close completely.  They have really helped to clean the fridge.  Having eggs cartons in the fridge takes up so much space.  And fridge space is precious.  These containers hold 24 eggs and they stack neatly. Once full I take the eggs and place them in cartons and give them to family and friends.  And when the girls are really cranking out the eggs to acquaintances and anybody walking past.

B01I6MHNQC,5.0,Pleasantly Surprised,"After three months of multiple times a wee use I have been pleasantly surprised by this countertop dishwasher. If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be very happy with it.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have stated, all of the countertop dishwashers on Amazon all come from the same factory and have the same innards, shop on price and looks. In my case, having a rental house away from home for a one year appointment, looks didn’t really matter. The Danby plain white one with push button controls is perfect.<br /><br />No, this won’t wash your stock pot or large sauce pan (maybe the sauce pan and some utinsels by themselves). However, for the day to day 90%? It’s great. It will wash all of your utensils, plates (even big oversized American dinner plates), mugs bowls and glassware.<br /><br />Simply replace the nozzle on your sink faucet and clip on the hose when you want to use it.<br /><br />This does take a good amount of counter top space, but fits underneath cabinets. In my 1950s era rental with original cabinets it clears them with a few centimeters to spare in height, and a few centimeters front to back. If you put a large toaster oven and a drip brew coffee maker side by side it would take up similar horizontal space.<br /><br />The inside is stainless steel with plastic coated metal wire trays that seem very high quality.<br /><br />Cleaning quality is on par with $4-500 price range standard dishwashers. Yes, it’s probably best if you rinse your dishes thouroughly first. I haven’t tried the jet dry feature. When the cycle is over I pop the door and let the water evaporate.<br /><br />It isn’t very noisy, but you will notice it unless your kitchen is blocked off from the rest of your dwelling. Mostly you can hear when the water is draining as it is coming out at high pressure.<br /><br />If you have a small apartment or a rental house with no dishwasher, this thing pays for its self in convenience and time saved (really, 8-10 days worth of chinese takeaway meals will cover the cost). When it’s time to move? Ask the property owner to take off $250 from your last month rent and leave it with them.",2018-03-24 17:25:29.319999933,2018,Positive,"Danby DDW621WDB Countertop Dishwasher with 6 Place Settings, 6 Wash Cycles and Silverware Basket, Energy Star-Rated with Low Water Consumption and Quiet Operation",Appliances,

B0021UYG66,5.0,Buy This Tool!,"I bought this wrench to help with the replacement of the mode shifter assembly on my 7-year-old GE profile washing machine.  The wrench allows you to remove the hub nut that attaches the washer's inner tub to the mode shifter assembly.<br /><br />The wrench itself is very simple.  It is made of two pieces of steel that fit together as a stack.  The handle portion of the tool interlocks with the nut driving plate.  Both pieces are much thicker and stronger than the pictures seem to indicate.  I was surprised at how much steel you are getting when you order this tool.<br /><br />The circular nut driving plate is actually cut slightly bigger than the hub nut on my washer.  My sense is that this allows you to grab onto highly corroded nuts that are no longer in good shape.  To make the wrench easier to use I taped the two pieces of the wrench together with blue painter's tape. This took up most of the slack around the nut, and allowed me to use the wrench as a single unit.<br /><br />There are several YouTube videos that clearly demonstrate how to disassemble GE washing machines.  One thing I learned from the videos, and other online postings is to use penetrating oil on the hub nut threads before attempting to remove the nut.  The other thing I learned from the videos is to not be shy about whacking the spanner wrench with a hammer to remove the nut.  I did both of these things and had my hub nut off in about 1 minute.  This tool is perfect for the job.<br /><br />The TB123A wrench so cleanly removed the hub nut, it allowed me to re-use the original nut and save $8 on a replacement.  This was totally worth the cost of the wrench.<br /><br />I was skeptical that I could buy appliance parts on Amazon, but this turned out to be a great experience.  I got everything I needed to fix my washer, and saved at least $300 on my repair.

B08224KN82,3.0,Cheap plastic parts snapped,"I bought this ice machine about 2 years ago and it worked fine, it made ice fast but now that I have had it awhile I have several items to note,<br /><br />1. The ice only taste as good as the water you fill it with, when you use filtered water, it taste great, when you use tap water, it taste terrible but that's not on the machine, that's the user.<br /><br />2. It doesn't have a self cleaner so you have to lug it over to the sink to wash and scrub in those hard to reach areas that grow mildew.<br /><br />3. Machine runs is loud.<br /><br />4. After 2 years, for whatever reason, the plastic hood that swings over the steel posts to make the ice, snapped off and has no way to be reattached. So because of this cheap plastic, I have an ice maker with a working motor but because of a plastic part, I have to replace it. I don't see how I can replace the hood unless I figure out how to take the entire thing apart.<br /><br />I've tried several times to attach an image from my iPhone but for some reason Amazon says ""hmm that didn't work"" 🤷🏻‍♀️",2023-01-24 11:10:12.382999897,2023,Neutral,"Igloo ICEB33SL Large-Capacity Automatic Portable Electric Countertop Ice Maker Machine, 33 Pounds in 24 Hours, 9 Ice Cubes Ready in 7 minutes, With Ice Scoop and Basket, Perfect for Water Bottles",Amazon Home,$225.00

B00IB4BMDQ,5.0,This product was extremely effective,"My dryer duct is about 25 feet long, so I actually needed two of these to fully plumb it out, but this did a great job for me. I went a couple of feet at a time and hooked it up to a handheld drill to make the brushing easier. The rods were flexible enough to fit around a couple of bends (and also to fold up in the relatively cramped space I had to work from).<br /><br />My only word of caution would be to get a brush that's long enough to run the full length of your duct and work from the inside out; trying to work toward the middle from each end is not a good idea because it can create a blockage in the middle.  Relatedly, I did run into a couple of very large blockages in the duct where I initially couldn't get through.  They were about 12 feet from the opening and under my living room floor, so at first I couldn't tell whether there was a bend that I couldn't get around or just a bad blockage. I took the brush off the end and just poked the rods in to see if they could get through--they did, so I at least knew that the duct was passable, even if the four-inch brush couldn't make it through. Because I had two of these kits, I had two brushes, so I trimmed one of the brushes down to a smaller size and was able to fit it through the jam and open it up.  I then put the larger brush back on and cleaned it out.<br /><br />Anyway, this really did the trick.

B07C3D6HDJ,4.0,It washes. What can I say?,"Hi.  I bought both the Magic Chef 2.0 cu ft. portable washer and 2.6 cu ft dryer at Walmart, so no damage, great packaging, extended warranty, and a brick & mortar to return it to if needed. Then I got the MC laundry rack for $50 at home depot, unfortunately realizing too late that they had the washer/dryer cheaper there than Walmart too. Everything was bought around Christmas time, so there might have been better deals. I paid about $522 total for w/d.<br /> I have been using this washer for a few weeks. Just 2 if us in the apt. and I wash 3 times a week. Just to make sure I maintain it well I made sure to read the manual completely. It has no agitator, which leaves more room for more items. Also, because of that, the washing rhythm is a pulse action. Just imagine Chubby Checker's twist at per 2 second speed and you got the image. There is minimal noise, quiet even, much less than a dish washer and not enough to disturb neighbors. Each cycle can be run individually or as a whole. It has a powerful spin cycle so that clothes come out minimally damp when done. Follow the directions! Make sure washer is level and only 3/4 full or you'll be mopping up a swimming pool.  I setup the washer in the kitchen, but the adapter that came with the washer did not fit my faucet. It looked like DANCO Dishwasher Snap Coupling Adapter from Amazon. At first, washing with water turned on continuously, there would be leaking at the faucet on low pressure, spurting when the machine was not drawing water. Then after using it some more, the adapter would blow clean off. So I bought the Smartfresh 7 piece adapter kit from Amazon.  I also figured I'm a renter, so I might need the variety of adapters for new places.  I was going to try the Danco Multi thread Garden Hose Adapter from Amazon, but to my surprise there was an adapter in the kit that looked just like it.  That was the one that fit on the faucet. No leaking whatsoever.  I had my hot and cold water turned on all the way using one intake hose at full pressure attached to the cold valve and that was a lot! Washer came with 2 quality intake hoses and one cheap looking drain hose.  I just protect the hot intake using the intake cap, since I am able to get hot or cold from the kitchen faucet.  I am now able to run it on full automatic instead of drawing buckets. The intake hose is probably a couple feet, which is long enough to reach my faucet, but the drain hose is too short, like 4 feet maybe. The washer has 2 adjustable back wheels, but I never used them. Even though I bought the Stalwart Rolling Dolly Cart before purchasing the washer, which makes it easier to maneuver it, I don't like the idea of having to put it in front of my kitchen sink during wash. It takes up much space that way. I bought another drain hose planning to replace it but the only video I saw for a portable washer involve opening up the machine. I didn't want to possibly void the warranty. I read reviews where other people just did a simple switch, but I might just use it to extend the discharge hose. I’ll see if it works out. I make sure clean the lint traps on both for each use. Keep in mind that the trap for the dryer is inside of the dryer. Due to other helpful reviews, I also got an indoor dryer ventilation kit and a stainless steel kitchen sink strainer to catch excess lint, from Amazon. Can’t clog the plumbing! I am also considering a stainless steel retractable clothesline.",2019-01-10 09:31:13.368999958,2019,Positive,Magic Chef 2.0 Cu. Ft. Compact Top-Load Washer,Automotive,

I've done a bunch of work in my kitchen but installing this stove is the one thing that's upgraded the look of the entire kitchen.  The reason I knocked off a star is because I switched over to propane and the orifice for the center burner is impossible to remove.  It's not a challenge, it's not difficult... it's impossible.  I used the correct sized wrench, the WD-40, and everything else I had in my tool arsenal.  I eventually gave up and came up with an alternate solution.

B00X196VJ6,4.0,Mostly Pros!!!  Just a few Cons,I have been using induction for at least 20 years. I had it when I lived in Japan and when I moved back to the states I was able to replace my oven range with an induction oven range. Using a typical electric glass cooktop was torture after being spoiled by induction. We recently moved and the house we bought had a 36 inch Jenn Air. It was original to the house so about 12 years old. Trying to adjust with the control knobs on this was  a major frustration and I had enough when a week ago I prepared a big Sunday meal with 4 burners going at the same time. I got on-line and found a good deal on this and purchased it straight away. It arrived last night and my husband who is a big breakfast person and everyday complained how he missed the induction we had installed it straight away. He is pretty handy but he did have some trouble installing since there is no plug in as it is wired. The wires from the old one did not match up perfectly. The controls are amazing(a huge plus from any induction I have used) and it is so quiet you will not even know it is on unless you turn it up to high. It also has a timer which is great if you are busy like us. The only reason I did not give it 5 star is because the hole for the old 36 inch is a bit bigger and I am having trouble finding a GE Trim Kit for the 36&#34; size. We did find the 30/32 inch kit on-line. It is available in black and white for about $100. It would be nice if they had it available in stainless steel as well.  Also it has a vent hood you have to attach under it and it has made the drawer where I keep all my flatware not useable. This is major since I really don't have anywhere else to put my flatware which I have a lot of. Since this was just installed and we have only used it a day I will update has need be. I am hoping after I post this that GE reaches out to me with some solutions for the issues we are having.,2016-05-11 19:26:02.000000000,2016,Positive,"GE CHP9536SJSS Cafe 36"" Gray Electric Induction Cooktop",Appliances,

B000BV6D5O,5.0,Works well and Saves time.,"I paid $4.00 for this 12 pack Mineral Absorption Pads.  That is less than about 33 cent each.  I used the mineral pad which came with my humidifier machine and used white vinegar lengthen the its use.  The idea is to use vinegar to dissolve the minerals deposited on the pad and to regenerate it.  The original pad eventually broke down after many usages.  In my experience, the pad becomes less effective after consecutive vinegar regeneration method.<br /><br />I were out of a pad and minerals deposited very quickly on the heating element of my humidifier.  I had to soak the heating element in vinegar every week for hours to loosen the mineral.  When I waited longer than a week, the deposited minerals became extremely tough to remove.  There were a lot of scrubbing.  These became very time consuming and labor intensive.  When the new pad came, I can see a huge difference.  I had been using the very first pad from the box.  It has been 2-3 weeks and there is minimal deposit on the heating element, though some.  33 cents for saving me hours of scrubbing my machine -- what an excellent time saver.<br /><br />The pad came bigger than my heating element, so I had to cut it to fit.  No big deal.  10 seconds of work.

I think all appliances should be built like old cars and tell-lie-vision could get parts for them anywhere and was easy to fix so I started to take the washing machine apart and checked It for sure the spin cycle motor went out and It would have Not been an easy fix and Nether did I know where to get parts for It therefore I bought this washing machine about the exact same thing just a little bit bigger maybe this one will last more than 2 years but If You go to Lowes or Home Depot that Is about how long this big brand name washing machines last now days about 2 year Not over 10 years as they used to, that Is why It only gets 3 stars because I also rate how easy Is It to repair....<br />Here Is a secret I figured out, If You get clothes as dirty as Me might first go to the car wash and clean them but what I found out about this washing machine It can act as an old washboard, Instead of filling the tub up full of Water put the clothe In and turn It on while the clothes are being whipped back and forth take a Garden hoes connected to the hot Water and spray the clothes, this washing machine does Not operate with the drain open so You will have to every few seconds open and close the drain to drain off the dirty Water then fill the tub with Water and wash as normal",2021-06-08 07:11:52.877000093,2021,Neutral,"Giantex Washing Machine, Twin Tub Washer and Dryer Combo, 20Lbs Capacity (12Lbs Washing and 8Lbs Spinning), Compact Portable Mini Laundry Washer for Apartment, Semi-Automatic, Inlet and Drain Hose",Appliances,$179.99

B07L8LMJ7S,5.0,Great little machine,"I love this little machine. I have 4 kids in a small apartment and my husband works in HVAC. We end up with a lot of dirty clothes. I was going to a laundromat once a week but with this pandemic I had been feeling increasingly anxious about going. With this little machine I can keep up with our laundry daily without going anywhere and ny husband can immediately wash his clothes right when he gets home so he is less likely to bring germs into our home. Also the pictures do not give justice to the pretty blue lighting of the machine. The only downsides are, it's not easy to move it around andthe buttons are too easy to press. I have accidentally turned it off mid cycle. It doesn't take up much more space than a large kitchen garbage can and it washes well.  One thing to keep in mind is it does not have the option to start at different stages of the washing process so if it gets shut off you have to restart it. This can be very irritating if you have kids that can press the buttons. I have it in my kitchen  which is blocked by a gate but even bumping into it in the small kitchen can turn it off. The hoses are not very long and the hook to put over the sink to hold the drain hose is not stable so you must attach it to something heavy enough to keep it in place or else you will flood your kitchen like I did the first time I used it.",2020-05-06 08:50:16.584000111,2020,Positive,The Laundry Alternative - Silk Lux Portable Mini Automatic Washing Machine - 7.7-Pound Load Capacity - Blue Lid,Appliances,

B00J5SECU2,1.0,"UPDATE: BADLY engineered washer, leaves clothes MOLDY. Read on...","UPDATE: As it turns out, I discovered that despite my many efforts to clean the machine, it ended up leaving my clothes smelling of mold. I live in the desert so this took a great deal of consideration to come to this conclusion. I've been more than fair in my review; the dryer works great but my disgust with the overall performance of the washer leaves me to rate this combo as one star. It's no longer available on Amazon but I'm not surprised as to why it's no longer for sale here. At first I thought that the HE performance may be removing the smell of fabric softeners from my clothes, but in the end it's the overall design of the machine that was causing my clothes to not only smell as though nothing was used to soften the fabrics, but that left the clothes smelling moldy. Keep in mind that I never let the clothes sit for longer than a few hours before drying, as I mentioned I did try running cycles with vinegar, tried using the cleaning cycle of the unit itself...to no avail. UGH. So I'm donating them to charity and will take the loss. I'll think twice before ever buying LG products again, that's for sure.<br />Former/prior review (left unedited):<br />Pros:  Beautiful units, great quality - doors and buttons, features. Easy to use once you start to better understand the cycle definitions. All of the features work well, i.e., the fabric softener scent sticks with the laundered items, which isn't the case with some of the other HE washers with which I've had some experience. Pros highly outweigh the cons!<br />Cons:  Love the units, except for a few things: mainly that the extremely large tub is somewhat deceiving with regard to the size of laundry that it will hold. Meaning, I tried to wash a few standard pillows in the &#34;bulky&#34; cycle and I would have thought that it would have sensed the size of the load and filled it enough to at least cover the pillows relatively well since the tub wasn't full by any stretch of the word. They did come out clean. This is but one example of how either I'm using the cycles wrong or it doesn't clean bulky items that well.

B075J8P21L,5.0,Full bearing and seal kit.,"i purchased this kit for my 14 year old LG front load washer. The original bearings had deteriorated so badly that the spin cycle caused a very loud roar and vibration.  This was not any easy fix and also required replacing the spyder shaft that was damaged. Removal of the old bearings was relatively simple after separation of the two outer drum halves and removal of the motor rotor and stator. A big hammer and brass drift knocked the old bearings out. The old seal literally fell out (probably the cause of bearing failure). Installing the new bearings was somewhat difficult as the fit in the drum unit was extremely tight. You have to be very careful to avoid damage when driving the new bearings into the drum bore. I used the outer race of the old bearing as a spacer and seated the new bearings with the large hammer and brass drift. I also used some sealant on the outer edges when installing the seal.<br />It's been nearly a year since I did this repair and the washer is still just as quiet as new. If you're up to it, this kit can revive a machine at a very reasonable price that would likely otherwise require junking and replacement with a new machine.",2023-04-05 06:15:53.924000025,2023,Positive,"XiKe 4036ER2004A, 4036ER4001B, 4280FR4048E and 4280FR4048L Front Load Washer Tub Bearing ＆ Seal Kit Rotate Quiet and Durable, Replacement for LG and Kenmore Etc.",Appliances,$29.99

B00B3WEOI8,4.0,These filters work well most of the time,"After reading several one star reviews for the Melitta disc filters I decided to try these with my Presto 12 cup percolator.<br /><br />The filter covers all the holes in the 3 1/2” inch basket.  There’s a circular perforation that allows the disc diameter to be reduced to 3” for smaller baskets (note: if you have a Presto percolator 3 1/2” fits). The filters come in a stack and some dexterity is required to separate the individual filters.  The filter can be used with standard pre-ground coffee purchased from the grocery store.<br /><br />A more demanding test of the filter is to grind your beans with an inexpensive electric grinder (e.g Krups), which typically produces some very fine grounds under the blade.  I’ve tried several different beans and have concluded that these filters are effective at retaining the small grounds produced by the electric grinder.  Finally I added a tablespoon of espresso grind directly on top of the filter and then added coarse percolator ground beans.  The coffee came through clear with no significant coffee residue.<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with these Brew Rite filters and will be reordering.<br /><br />Updated 8/2/20: I’ve been using these filters for over a year now.  If you are looking for a percolator filter that will retain all the grinds all the time, you’ll be disappointed. These filters do not work as well as the conical or basket filters used in drip coffee makers.  It is not unusual to find some grinds or fine residue at the bottom of the cup.  Finally, if your basket is 3 1/2” then you don’t need to tear the filter at the circular perforation (see above).  It’s likely that the perforation decreases filter performance.",2019-05-10 13:09:23.286999941,2019,Positive,"Brew Rite Coffee Filter, 3"" and 3 1/2"" Disc, White",Amazon Home,$4.61

B07PCKB1NF,2.0,Wheels making noise after barely 2 months,"The pulley and belt are still running rock solid.  From what I can tell two of the wheels seem to be operating alright, but at least one, if not two of them are making a lot of noise.  Honestly though, its pretty impossible to know for sure.<br /><br />Last week it was extremely loud, to the point that my wife didn't want to run it for fear of burning out the pulley and belt again.  I took the dryer apart, sprayed some WD40 on the wheels, and put it all back together.  The sounds went away for about a week and now its starting to make a low pitch growl of sorts.  I did not expect the WD40 to last long, it never does, but I wanted to identify the root cause of the noises, of which it did.<br /><br />In short, the pulley and belt have been running great.  The wheels, not so much, to the point that I'm either going to try to buy a different set.  I saw the comments about contacting the seller through their profile, but I must be too dense to figure out how to do that.<br /><br />EDIT: Now August 30, I took the dryer apart AGAIN (this time due to the heating element going bad), and found the rear right roller had completely burnt out...melting a good bit of the plastic.  Luckily I had one of the old original rollers sitting around to replace the replacement.  Extremely frustrating.<br /><br />On a side note, I will never buy another Samsung washer/dryer ever again.",2020-04-20 05:13:15.450999975,2020,Negative,"JACS Upgraded Samsung Dryer Repair Kit - Compatible with Samsung Dryer Roller Replacement Kit, Samsung Dryer Parts DC97-16782A Dryer Roller, DC93-00634A Idler Pulley & 6602-001655 Dryer Belt",Appliances,$9.99

The size forces you to put in just the right amount for one mug, and it makes perfect brewed coffee from it.  It tastes great.<br /><br />I don't get a mess from using this like other reviewers. There is a very minor amount of spilled liquid surrounding the My K-Cup that isn't there using a normal K-Cup, but it is not a big deal.",2010-01-20 19:44:58.000000000,2010,Positive,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter - Old Model,Amazon Home,$19.25

I was thrilled to be able to use an AmazonBasics item as I change my filters often, probably every 2-3 mo. vs every 6 mo. as I live in the desert and the water here is hard and full of minerals.  So far I have found this to be working well, and it was as easy as the Maytag one to install.  I just made sure to run a couple of gallons of water through the interior water dispenser to make sure you have removed any particles out of the filter and that the water is running clear.  My ice cube water runs through this filter too so its real easy for me to tell when I need to change the filter!  For the price difference, Amazon has me at 19.99!!  Sorry Maytag!

MJX41178908 did not work because the connector for the rubber hose that goes into the refrigerator is wider so I returned it, but 5220JB2010A (which is this current listing) worked perfectly.

B07G72JM63,5.0,Life changing,"My house and my clothes used to smell like the food I cook.  If I sauteed onions and garlic, I would smell like sauteed onions and garlic.  If I pan fried a steak, I would smell like steak.  If I fried anything - I smelled like a fast food worker after an eight hour shift.  My poor kids' eyes would tear up from sauteed onion fumes, while they were sitting 20 feet away.<br /><br />My kitchen is located at least 15 feet away from a window, so opening a window is not an option (not that a window is a substitute to a vent) and I used to have an over the range microwave with what is ironically called a ""vent"".  Needless to say, other than creating loud white noise, and blowing more food smell back on me, it would be utterly useless.<br /><br />NOT ANYMORE!<br /><br />Over a year ago, I replaced the over the range microwave with this fine product (by a professional, since I didn't have an air vent hookup to the outside).  By far, this product has been the most impactful product I have purchased, and it has truly been life hanging.  I no longer smell like food.  My kids no longer tear up when I sautee onions.  For heavy odors (which is most odors produced by pan frying and sauteing), I use the strongest power setting.  For steam, I use lower settings.<br /><br />Cleaning: After frying something, I can definitely feel grease on the bottom of the vent grills.  They are super easy to remove, and depending what I cook, I clean them once or twice a month.  I usually use a brush and soap to clean them in the sink before I put it through a dishwasher wash, because I take comfort in seeing the grease be brushed away (all those years of pent up microwave vent anger).  The vent grills come out squeaky clean from the dishwasher and easy put back on the vent.  I do wipe down any greasy area above the vent grills prior to putting the vents back, because oil is a witch with a capital B.<br /><br />Power settings and noise level - Strong power setting naturally will be loud, and yes, if my kids try to talk to me across the room, they will have to talk loud, but I tell you this, they will much rather yell across the room than wipe away their irritated teary eyes.<br /><br />I do believe that houses should, at the very least, come setup with vent hoses to the outside - if not already have a strong vent.  A strong vent is a must have in any household that cooks - and yes, it is worth EVERY PENNY in getting a powerful enough vent.  I wouldn't skimp on $100-$150 to get something cheeper that is not effective enough in keeping smell out.<br /><br />Happy cooking!",2020-12-14 21:25:16.345000029,2020,Positive,"Hauslane | Chef Series 30” PS10 Under Cabinet Range Hood | PRO PERFORMANCE | Stainless Steel Electric Stove Ventilator | 3 Speed Exhaust Fan, Bright LED Lights & Delay Auto Shut-Off",Appliances,$379.99

B003JN51PE,5.0,"Wonderful! Great for Cloth Diapers, too!","We had a TL GE that was really destroying our clothes. At first we thought it was the hard water in the city, but after hooking it up to a water softener, we realized it was more likely than not the center agitator. So, out with the old (rental) and in with this great buy! We used to have a FL HE washer but left that at the house we rented out, so we were also used to having to use less detergent. It really is necessary to use a detergent made for an HE washer and to use as little as possible. As such, we use country save, since it's also a cloth diaper friendly detergent. For the first time in over a year, our clothes *feel* clean, they smell clean, the diapers are getting super duper clean, and, best of all, my clothes are intact! It has a great capacity and I love the drum design. I also like the clear top, so that I can see what's going on (an important feature when stripping cloth diapers of build-up). Definitely going to investigate the dryer to compliment the washer.<br /><br />The *one* thing I find odd, and I'm on the hunt for weather all of this model do this or if it is just our unit, is that the control panel ""sweats"" when washing with hot water. It doesn't appear to affect the controls, but definitely worth buying the added warranty protection just in case! I'd do that anyway with a machine with so many working parts, but figured I'd throw this into the review in case someone else experiences it or knows if this is ok/dangerous.",2013-01-29 02:46:28.000000000,2013,Positive,Whirlpool WTW5700XW,Amazon Home,

B008KBUHRW,5.0,Love This Cook-Top!,I bought this cook-top last summer and absolutely love it.  I have a white kitchen so I wanted the mirror finish and even though the price was higher than the black version I decided to just bite the bullet and go for it.  And I am so happy I did.<br /><br />Also in the running at the time was a Wolf gas cook-top but I just did not want to deal with the constant more complicated cleaning.  What a wise decision as I am always sponging off spills and other messes which is so easy with the glass.  And it does not show wipe marks like the black version tends to do as I have been told by someone who has one.<br /><br />It is so easy to set the temperature.  The more you use it the more intuitive it becomes to know the correct number to use.  I can just set it and walk away.  And you can also set a timer for each burner so it will turn off automatically.<br /><br />There are some issues to be aware of but nothing that can't be adapted to just like any cooking source.  You need pots that are compatible.  I had to buy a few new ones as not all of my previous ones worked.  No problem really and it gave me a chance to update some of my old ones.  I carried a little magnet around with me when I went pot shopping.<br /><br />You also cannot do the &#34;chef shake&#34; on the pans without potentially causing scratches.  I am pretty careful about this but when I make popcorn I can just put a paper towel or parchment paper between the pot and the burner to avoid this issue.  So this is really a non-issue for me but it might be for someone else.<br /><br />Unlike a gas stove there are burner sizes which are more suited to various pot sizes.  For example I have a small butter warmer which will only work on the small back right element.  But again these are things which I have become accustomed to and in no way makes me wish I had chosen gas.  I love that I do not have to guess what the right gas setting is for cooking.<br /><br />I just love my cook-top and I am so happy with my choice.  It works for me.,2016-01-29 14:14:10.000000000,2016,Positive,Thermador CIT365KM 36 in. Induction Cooktop44; New Silver Mirror Color,Appliances,

B00294O77W,1.0,Do Not Buy,"We got this dishwasher when we were renovating the gutted house we bought. I was doing so many things (floors/cabinets/walls/electrical/construction) that I just went into Best Buy and randomly picked appliances. The first year the dishwasher started leaking from the lower right onto the floor. The Frigidaire warranty was still in effect so I called them and they came out and replaced the  side splash guards, the bottom splash guard and the door gasket. The side and door splash guards were visibly ripped. The leaking stopped.<br /><br />2 years later the same leak appeared. So called the home warranty company and they came out and did the same thing, replacing those parts and the leak stopped again. So if you own one of these and are getting leaks out of the front, check the gasket that runs around the tub and seals to the door. Costs $8 to replace and its easy to push in and replace yourself.

We do a lot of Indian style cooking and the previous GE hood we owned did a pathetic job (with extremely loud noise) - so this one is far-far better.<br />As a matter of fact, I think this was the right choice for me, since other branded models cost so much more and you can expect your electric / gas bill to go up - more the cfm, more surrounding air the hood draws out - meaning your AC / heater has to work overtime to keep up with all the air that is drawn out !",2012-12-14 12:06:58.000000000,2012,Positive,"AKDY 30"" Under Cabinet Stainless Steel LED Display Touch Control Panel Kitchen Vent Fan Range Hood & Remote Control",Amazon Home,

B004H3XX1Y,5.0,"Exact replacement, restored ice dispenser operation to ""like new""","Side-by-side refrigerators are incredibly complicated.  Cold air just doesn't want to flow naturally from left to right; it wants to drop by gravity from the top down.  So the refrigerators have a complex array of electronics, ducting, fans, tubing, and device actuators like this little solenoid.  I my opinion, replacement of this solenoid was a simple repair, very much a one-hour do-it-yourself project.<br />It's an exact fit, genuine GE replacement part.  You don't get much for your 25 dollars, but Amazon is cheaper than other sources.<br />My refrigerator is ten years old, I guess in that time the old solenoid slowly became corroded and lost strength.  Finally the ice chute began freezing up and the water dispenser stopped squirting (I still haven't fixed that problem - thawing didn't help).<br />There are videos on the web that show how to pop off the door trim and disassemble the dispenser.  My biggest advice:  don't forget to pull the plug or kill the circuit breaker!<br />The solenoid is held in place with three screws, recessed deep in the dispenser cavity, so a magnetic bit holder helps a lot.  The part does not include replacement screws, so I put a drop of olive oil over the old ones to lubricate and give them some protective coating.  The solenoid DOES come with a new plunger (I put a little olive oil on it too).  First hang the plunger from its hook, then slide it into the solenoid core as you wiggle the part into position.  Now you've got a wire from the new solenoid, snake it toward the front so it's there while you reassemble the dispenser hardware.<br />Power on and you're ready to go!<br />I noticed that the Dispenser Door now snaps solidly closed; it hasn't done that for a long time!<br /><br />Note:  For a few dollars more, I also ordered and replaced the General Electric WR17X11653 Dispenser Door.  Not completely necessary, but perhaps the old rubber seals were tired.  Hopefully I won't have to disassemble these components for another ten years!",2015-07-11 18:19:55.000000000,2015,Positive,GE WR62X10055 Genuine OEM Dispenser Solenoid Assembly for GE Refrigerator,Tools & Home Improvement,$42.99

The metal nut was also fused to the motor spindle. See photo. I tried to cut the nut off with a dremel tool, but the metals were melted together.  So motor was kaput, too.  LUBE the spindle threads before you install the new blower to hopefully prevent the threads of the nut and the motor fusing together.  Make sure you insert the Blower tabs (feet) into the cabinet holes before securing the Blower with its two screws.

The fiberglass tape was a must, because you don't want a spark or fire to start inside the insulation that lines the back of your oven wall. So far, this has worked great.

Because of these filters, that vicious cycle is over!<br />The filters are excellent quality. I really see/taste no difference when comparing them to the actual Cuisinart filters. They get the job done well! I LOVE that each filter comes in an individual package, so they don't get gross while they aren't in use. At first I thought a 12 pack would be too many, but I was wrong! It's great having these on hand all the time and not having to scramble or drink nasty coffee.<br />They come with clear instructions that are very easy to follow and they are super simple to install.<br />If you like a good cup of coffee all the time, then this is a purchase you need to make!",2021-01-23 21:06:33.700999975,2021,Positive,K&J 12-Pack of Cuisinart Compatible Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for Coffee Makers - Fits all Cuisinart and Braun BrewSense Coffee Makers,Amazon Home,$16.80

B002YPC2NM,5.0,"Easy to use, fast, cheap - but don't overpack the filters!","Have had the EZ-Cup for about 2 months and used it daily. It's been great - cheaper than buying even generic K-cups, easy to use, fast and much less wasteful (environmentally). I don't have extra time in the morning and I was worried that this would take a lot longer than throwing in a K-cup but it doesn't.  I leave mine in overnight after use so it's dried out by the time I take it out in the morning and is easy to trash without dripping all over.  I then put in a new filter, scoop coffee in, and it's good to go.<br /><br />The only caveat is that you don't want to overfill it.  When I pack in the coffee grounds into the filter with the spoon (I mean really press them down), the machine doesn't function properly (it will produce only a very small amount of coffee).  Also, after a few days of this, our machine got clogged, wouldn't function at all, and we had to call customer service to figure out how to fix it.  Since then, we've put a normal amount of coffee into the filter without packing it down and haven't had any problems.

B000DLB2FI,3.0,"3 stars w/out mod, 4 stars with","My main gripe is that you do have to modify it. The My K Cup by itself makes some seriously weak coffee. So I've done what everyone else has done and cut the top off of a regular K Cup, put that in the reservoir, and then put the filter in that. Now, if your not comfortable with reusing the plastic K Cup, then you probably will not want to buy this product. You might want to check out the Ekocert stainless steel reusable K Cup. Without the modification, it makes weak coffee - so buy bolder coffee if you do decide to purchase and not modify.<br /><br />I watched a review that stated these reusable K Cup filters held 10 grams of coffee, and that a regular K Cup can hold 11. Which seems like it would already set you up to make weaker coffee - hence encouraging people to buy K Cups? Maybe, but I grind my coffee and like to think that maybe it's a bit fresher, so therefore I can go with a little less. How I get my best cup is 1) use the modification, 2) grind my coffee on the espresso setting on my Hamilton Beach blade grinder, 3) fill the filter almost to the top with coffee (about 2.5 scoops of beans for me) and tap it down - I tap it on the counter and also gently press down the top with the back of my coffee scoop 4) use the 8 ounce setting for regular coffee or 10 if I'm using a darker roast. I also clean it after every use.<br /><br />I own the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034J6QIY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and love it so far.",2015-01-17 18:42:34.000000000,2015,Neutral,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter - Old Model,Amazon Home,$19.25

I checked the manufacturer's website and one metal knob was $64!  I researched the type of inner I needed on my knobs and ordered two different sets on Amazon.  These happened to be the ones I opened first.  They fit perfectly, look so much better than the knobs that came with the stove, and are of great quality!  Got the whole set for about the price of one knob on the manufacturer's website.

My leak ended up to be the hot air vent at the top left of the door.  Water leaked thru the gasket inside the door and came out the bottom looking like a seal leak.  Second the lip of the seal faces inward.  Third, locate the seal at the bottom of your door before installing.  On the whirlpool this seal is a flap integral with the door.  The new seal MUST overlap this door seal on the bottom or there will be a leak at that location.  Fourth, the new seal has three ridges along the v-shape portion that goes into the groove on the dishwasher.  I only pushed the seal in as far as the second ridge, then closed the door for an hour or so then ran a hot wash.  Sealed totally.  My first try had a slight leak at one location when I pushed the seal all the way in initially.  My 10 yr old door is probably a bit warped.",2022-03-04 18:23:21.302000046,2022,Positive,W10542314 Dishwasher Door Seal Gasket Strike（Improved version）by Romalon Fit for Whirl-pool AP5650274 PS5136129 W10284090 8268888,Appliances,$10.99

B07HVSR8RF,5.0,BEST MINI WASHER EVER,"I just received my mini washer & spinner.  I didn't have to read instructions as everything is quite self explanatory.  While I love my machine, here are the down sides of this unit. The hose that connects to the faucet to fill the machine with water does not fit a standard US water faucet. You must get an adapter at HOME DEPOT, AMAZON or where ever. Or you can just fill the washing machine side with water manually.  Second the drain hose is sooooo short that it's useless.  You must figure out a way to drain the water by either fitting the unit in your kitchen sink (which is totally impossible) or put the unit in your bathtub and wash and spin your clothes in the bathtub.  Other than those two issues, this machine is a kick ass little washing machine and the spinner, spins so great that your clothes come out practically dry.  It's AMAZING.  I did two loads.  First load I put in 10 underware, 4 pairs of socks, two bras,  3 spaghetti string blouses, 2 think spandex gym pants and 4 wash cloths.  WOW!... SIMPLY FANTASTIC.

I found these at half the price of those on parts-specific web sites.  They also were delivered in one day, a great advantage.  But the Instruction sheet that came with these parts was terrible.  The first instructions were to remove the old shelf and then remove the old adjusters from the rack.  That will be easier said than done for some.  The old adjustors are held on by some clips that are not all that obvious.  After that is done, the 2 page instruction sheet had 10 photographs to show what to do, but every one of them is out of focus, and some details are fairly small.  I found you could go on YouTube and search on the part number and find very good videos showing exactly what to do.  This is quite helpful, especially when the new adjusters are a redesign of the old ones, so they don't look much alike.  After watching the video a couple of times, I was able to change the parts easily and quickly.  The new ones fit fine, and the whole replacement process took less than a half hour.

The paper filters are designed to drain at an ideal rate and fit snug to the glass so you can fill the paper filter past the level of your coffee and the water will still drain through the coffee at a pretty consistent rate.  If you fill the stainless strainer above the level of your coffee, you will have straight water escaping the sides of the filter and diluting your coffee.<br /><br />Because the stainless drains faster, a finer grind should be used.  I like using the strainer and once you get things dialed in it brews a nice cup of coffee with a distinctly different flavor than paper.  I still use paper once in a while but mostly use the stainless to reduce waste and save a few dollars over time.",2019-04-21 19:34:30.947999954,2019,Positive,Willow & Everett Pour Over Coffee Dripper - Reusable Drip Cone Filter & Strainer - Paperless Filters,Amazon Home,$16.68
